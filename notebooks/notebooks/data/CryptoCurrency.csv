What is the Best Cold Wallet? (DECEMBER 2022) For Android & Supports Major Alt Coins,2,zopsnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zopsnk/what_is_the_best_cold_wallet_december_2022_for/,0,1671337341.0,"I've seen Ledger, Trezor, Arculus, Keystone, Bitbox02, Ellipal, then Coldcard too but that is bitcoin only. I also saw Neko but I couldn't find much personal testimony with it. *Which one* is the best/which one do you guys prefer to use? For android with flexibility of some more popular alt coins.


Now, after doing some of my own research these are the issues I found people say each one has:


**Ledger:**
• Had a huge data breach which leaked addresses and other data of customers


• Doesn't have an address verification, it has a verification but you can't tell it apart from an unauthorized access


• People said that they had a black screen of death


• Some people said they had poor customer support


**But some people have no issues with Ledger and it's popular so idk**


**Trezor:**
• Someone paid an engineer to crack their Trezor to get their stuff back for them and succeeded meaning it could be prone to other Trevor devices being infiltrated


• You have to manually check to see if co-signers are safe


**Some people really like Trezor and have no issues and it's another popular one**

**Arculus:**
• This one personally really appealed to me until ***I realized the seed phrase is generated on the app on your phone…*** I brought up this issue with their team and they said you can disconnect from internet and data and set it up and the seed phrase only shows once but idk about this being 100% safe for sure just with on airplane mode. 


Would a hacker be able to record the info such as a screen capture while I'm not connected to wifi or data then when I reconnect it would get sent to them? 


*Apparently you don't have to re-type the key in though to confirm, you just click the words in the correct order, so you don't have to worry about keylogging* their team told me.


• If you have **to restore your wallet** however, they said in that case **you do have to type in the seed phrase** and they said to do it in airplane mode but that it could still be susceptible to keyloggers, but they said that would be an issue for any wallets you use, not just Arculus. (Wouldn't that be an issue just for hot wallets though?)


**Keystone:**
• Have to add new addresses manually which is annoying if someone sends coins frequently


**Bitbox02:**
• Lack of coin availability compared to other cold wallets


• I read that this is lack of 3rd party exchange integration compared to other cold wallets


**Ellipal:**
• Some people said it lags


• Sometimes takes minutes to hours to days to update balance


• QR code on some phones won't read the QR code because the aspect ratio is skewed


• Someone reported they could not take out XRP out of their Ellipal


So after all that research I'm not quite sure which one is the best option. What do you guys swear by? What about you people who have tried many different cold wallets?",2022-12-18 06:22:21

G20 Countries to Build Crypto Policy Consensus for Better Global Regulation,0,zop89z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zop89z/g20_countries_to_build_crypto_policy_consensus/,3,1671335529.0,"**The G20 countries aim to build a policy consensus on crypto assets for better global regulation. “After the crypto meltdown which we have seen recently, it is clear that we need internationally agreed standards on regulation,” said the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath.**

G20 Nations Discuss Crypto Regulation:

The G20 finance and central bank deputies met for the first time under India’s presidency on Dec. 13-15 in Bengaluru.

Ajay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary, said at a news conference Wednesday that the G20 nations aim to build a policy consensus on crypto assets for better global regulation. Noting that the implications of crypto assets for the economy, monetary policy, and the banking sector should be studied for the creation of the consensus, Seth was quoted by Reuters as saying:

    The regulation should flow from the policy view taken. In fact, one of the priorities which have been put on the table is to help countries build a consensus for policy approach to crypto assets.

The collapse of crypto exchange FTX has led to calls for better oversight of the crypto market. FTX filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. on Nov. 11 and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was arrested this week. The U.S. government and regulators have brought several fraud charges against FTX and Bankman-Fried.

The members of the Group of 20 (G20) are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the U.K., the U.S., and the European Union. The group represents around 85% of the world’s GDP.

IMF’s Gita Gopinath on Globally Agreed Crypto Standards:

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s deputy managing director, Gita Gopinath, said Thursday that the G20 under India’s presidency can make progress in three areas: debt management, crypto regulation, and climate finance. Gopinath is currently in India to attend G20 meetings.

She explained that globally agreed norms are needed for crypto regulations, elaborating:

    After the crypto meltdown which we have seen recently, it is clear that we need internationally agreed standards on regulation. Progress on that front being able to accomplish that by 2023 would be a concrete outcome.

Seth also said Wednesday that one of the key agendas that the G20 will discuss is the global usage of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has started both wholesale and retail digital rupee pilots.",2022-12-18 05:52:09

One [wallet](https://opensea.io/0xfb65415Ca83B69DA9bC56B4C9C2334fa402baCd7?tab=collected) minted 80 ETH worth of cards. They hold 2.22% of the entire collection, and none of them have been sold or moved.

[This address holds the #1-1000 of the Trump Cards, $500k of wETH, and $300 of MATIC.](https://preview.redd.it/hbibsj3rhk6a1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d23e60b17b817070b3b9483c778a6cb97f8271)

Their address has been getting $30-200 of wETH sent every few minutes/seconds, probably being the one of two royalty addresses getting fees. Pay attention to the highlighted 0xfb654 address below:

[Two addresses are receiving the exact same amount of wETH in a sale tx. The royalty fee is 10&#37;, and these addresses are earning 10&#37; of 0.5075 wETH \(the sale price\).](https://preview.redd.it/s56b1bfahk6a1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=d40a58d9ec224f3ad4b59831e9232b3c5123ed53)

What's interesting is this address is a Gnosis safe, so it's a multisig. The multisig was [generated](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x3d69372255ff99a8ef09a4017666aaabf0a4465aab4f107b32868329fab95ab2) 14hrs before their [mints](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x5f8c593f7febcc4f388efa2f497231496de7d81053eeb8104f889160ffdabe40), so it's evident that it was made for this collection.

One [address](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x116311805390458bb65b2954290c2eb8c944e41d) has made three executive transactions (telling the multisig what to do), withdrawing a few MATIC at a time. This was likely a test to see if the multisig operated as intended.

Seeing as this address is likely earning the royalties, and owns so many of the Trump Cards, this is almost certainly someone in Trump's organization.

Are the fees so high because everyone is withdrawing their coins from the exchanges?,2,zon1d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zon1d9/are_the_fees_so_high_because_everyone_is/,28,1671328785.0,"Hey guys

Today I have sent some coins on my Ledger. I found the fees for the transaction to be quite high. I remember that the last time I didn't have such high fees. I remember I paid maybe 40 cents fee.     Is this due to Coinbase, Ledger or the network in general? Is it because the network is so busy that everyone is withdrawing their coins from the exchanges? Will the fees be even higher if bitcoin becomes more popular? Do you have any tips on how to pay less fees?

Here's a picture of it. It's in German but I think you know what it's about.

It is an algorithmic stablecoin collateralized by the **WAVES token**, which fell from a marketcap of $6B in March 2022 to $700M after the collapse of UST, all the way down to $170M now. WAVES's market cap has been below USDN's marketcap since June 2022, so it's no surprise that USDN depegged without its collateralized backing.

What is surprising is that it's still in the Top 75 by market cap.

**Unlike Terra's UST**, USDN didn't immediately collapse once the collateralization ratio fell below 1. That's mainly because of the complicated system Neutrino Protocol used that requires owners to hold [NSBT and SURF tokens](https://docs.neutrino.at/neutrino-smart-contracts-and-business-logic#backing-ratio) to swap USDN for WAVES, and the lack of liquidity to exit. It took 6 months before it collapsed.

Neutrino USD is similar to **Tron's USDD**: overcollateralized but with little liquidity to exit. I'm betting that USDD will also eventually collapse as its collateralization ratio keeps falling too, but that will take much longer.",2022-12-18 02:58:48

I read it I the WSJ, I think it is basically true.  Early on, no executive at Enron would crack and spill the beans. Investigators hit a wall. Then this happened:  They get Andrew Fastow (Enron CFO) and his wife in a room. ""Oh, so you *both* signed these fraudulent tax returns... right? So you can *both* go to jail. ...and let's see, you have two kids... I guess we'll let the US Gov't decide what to do with them as you both go to jail *at the same time.*""  And **BOOM** they cut a deal so they could go to jail at different times. He got 6 years, she served around a year for income tax fraud -- they weren't kidding around with her. Funny -- she negotiated something like 5 months prison, and after it was all over, she got 12 months. Nice!

So... I wonder if when talking to SBF they are saying ""OK, you parents were involved in these real estate purchases. Their names are on the paperwork. I'm just thinking out loud here... how long do you want *your mom* to be in jail? 1 year? 5 years? Or do you want to start talking more?""

This cannot possibly be a valid metric used to determine solvency. 

Of course they will always have enough BUSD to show that liabilities are covered. They are the printing press that creates the liquidity that determines their own backing. BUSD will always be 1:1 with USD until suddenly, and all at once, it isn’t. 

All that I see when I look at this audit is the dangerous idea that “well BUSD hasn’t collapsed yet, unlike the stablecoin of this other equivalent exchange that got caught”. The path down for FTX was an instantaneous vertical line, and all this audit shows is how quickly the same can happen to Binance if enough people decide that BUSD holds no true value. BUSD may have valid applications, but at the end of the day you can’t (yet) use it to finance mortgages, pay back student loans, or use it as a medium of exchange outside of a vacuum.

This NFT/Crypto Wallet stuff is super confusing. 

First, in my reddit Avatar styles stuff, I have 3 minted avatars that I own. My recap collectible, my Redit Cup 2022 collectible, and a Singularity collectible. I finally figured out how to connect my reddit vault to meta mask, and then connect that meta mask wallet to open sea, but, open sea only shows 2 collectibles, it doesn't show my Singularity collectible... what gives?

Also, after connecting my Reddit vault to MetaMask, how do I view my moons... My metamask wallet doesn't show my Reddit NFT's either, there is a little import button, do I have to import them? Or are they only viewable on opensea... 

Also, I created an opensea profile a long time ago that matches my username here on reddit, which is the same username I use everywhere, to keep my crypto and trading activities synchronous across platforms... is there some way for me to make that profile the one that owns/displays these NFT's, and my moons, etc. I feel like by the end of this I'm gonna have 10+ different wallets and opensea accounts and profiles and.... stupid. 

Next, I had to delete metamask on my phone and re-download in order to use my reddit seedphrase to access my reddit vault. So now do I just connect my original metamask account I guess, with my eth? And do I have to have all of these accounts separate, I can't just merge them or something? 

I probably have a thousand more questions because honestly this crypto wallet stuff is pretty ridiculous. It shouldn't have to be this hard (that's what she said), and crypto probably won't get readily adopted until someone makes this wallet junk not stupid. 

Also, I might be stupid, but I'm not that stupid, I'm not going to give anyone my seedphrases, or passwords, or access, or click the link you DM me, or transfer anything to you so you can send it to the 'right' place, or send me 'double,' or touch your special places, or whatever else.

The media, politicians and normies have had a field day mocking us given all the failures we have seen. What these people fail to understand many of them because they simply do not want to understand is that all these failures have had centralized points of failure. Be it Ronin, FTX, Luna, 3ac or Solana. What has not failed? Decentralization. Things like Bitcoin, Ethereum Rocketpool, and DEFI in general have not failed. Why? Because the decentralized nature of these protocols does not allow for one individual or a group of individuals to make decisions that affect the rest. No single human can make changes to a protocol, code or monetary policy. Ok, So some protocols have governance voting. Well, that is called community participation and this means we all have a say on the direction we want our protocol to go or the policies to be implemented moving forward.

Whenever someone approaches me to mock me for being in crypto I laugh and remind them that the ethos of crypto is alive and kicking. The chore values of decentralization are today stronger than ever. That I am so happy for all the centralized crooks being exposed and yet I can feel empathy for all the victims of these thieves.

We must continue to push for decentralization. We must continue to invest in decentralized projects. We need to get in and out of centralized exchanges. Learn and teach about self custody. Guard our private keys like our lives depend on it. The tech will improve. It will become safer and the UX will be top notch in due time. For the time being we ""the early ones"" have the privilege of being part of something new, unique and special that can change the lives of so many. 

Decentralization has won in 2022 and will continue to be the one and most important factor as we interact with these protocols. Its not that hard guys. Stick to decentralization. Projects with fundamentals and real life use cases and we will all be fine.

They are basically going to give money out of their pockets till the time DCG pays them back. DcG has suspended repayments until the liquidity issue has been resolved. DCG told that they will present a plan in the coming weeks.

Last few days, We have seen a bank run from Binance exchange over a rumor of Binance insolvency! This rumor gets some more fire when the Binance POR (Proof of reserve) auditor deleted Its Audit report from the website. 

This resulted in over 10B+ fund withdrawals from Binance where 3.4B was in Stablecoin. 

While the liquidity gets dried up on centralized exchanges, the same goes for Decentralized exchange aka DEX. 

It creates liquidity pressure and a lot of opportunity for Liquidity stakers to grab high APYs. 

Uniswap currently offering 37% APY for DAI/USDT pair over the ETHEREUM network.  The pair currently holds  4Million in liquidity. The APR soared sharply over 3X in a month. Gives a perfect example of liquidity demand in the pair.

Another dex Pancakeswap seems to be facing the problem which means another high-yield opportunity! 


132% APR(at the time of writing) in USDT/USDC pair.

Summary of random interesting facts about the Reddit Recap 2022 Collectible Avatars,17,zoa30k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zoa30k/summary_of_random_interesting_facts_about_the/,27,1671294805.0,"## Reddit Recap 2022 Collectible Avatars

This is just a collection of random interesting facts I've found about the Reddit Recap 2022 Collectible Avatars.

The Reddit NFT minter is currently [the #1 address in the charts](https://polygonscan.com/topstat#OverviewDay7) for both ""**Top Gas Used**"""" and ""**Top Txn Count**"" for the ENTIRE Polygon PoS network (for the past 7 days)

https://preview.redd.it/8h6f5axuuh6a1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=e259f1028699e63f2c702ebd85b1662a378de6da

## Efficient Batch minting

* All the ERC-1155 Reddit NFTs being minted right now by Reddit are using **batch minting** to save on Tx fees by using less gas.
* Reddit is minting up to [200 NFTs at a time at 6M gas](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xf9130e0b3fdea591a5ccc5b5f8126cdda2f17a0e6c43f89677f72ebfee52b591), which is about 30k gas per NFT. That's currently $0.001/NFT mint.
* This is about a 50-75% savings in gas compared to the usual single-minting. For example, [Token ID 5320581](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x2f1120052d9ee0277d09d83e1edcea30da3f18e7ba85215a70abc3a66c5a8583) of the same collection was single-minted at the cost of 65k gas. Minting NFTs on other less-efficient contracts can cost as much as 120-150k gas, so this is an extremely-efficient minting.
* 30k gas per mint is the equivalent of doing 250 TPS for minting on Polygon PoS (or 42 TPS if this were Ethereum mainnet)

## Collectors and NFTs

* **Over 3 days, 950,000 ERC-1155 tokens have been deployed at the cost of \~$1300 to Reddit. The contract is still minting hundreds of NFTs per minute non-stop.**
* All the ERC-1155 NFTs are being stored on IPFS (deployed using Infura as a gateway)
* [List of largest collectors](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc8d3a3a83bde5dad06d436694e3e22ac3e64d577#balances)
   * Currently, there is 1 whale with 50 NFTs
   * There are 13 others with 10+ NFTs
* &#x200B;

[The 1st 3 tokens minted: World Travelers, Enlightenment Seekers, and Coin Collectors](https://preview.redd.it/cwt9x7pwuh6a1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=014510405ab6a68fa8cd66b79f5d3751fd4f4c87)

* **First token minted** (ID 1) was deployed 9 days ago, but the [transaction failed](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xf930db7c6546d6ac072c0f06315ac22575ab6809d8251710fb9a7e376eea3b2e). Otherwise, it would've been this [World Travelers #2 NFT](https://reddit.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdjnBgh7nmSF3Wf5qDms8XGP9GdsvQTEHjGkJsxxgh8un). (It was later re-minted in a batch transaction.)
* **First successful token minted**, [Enlightenment Seekers #1](https://reddit.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXB2ZaAYwLN7ibyGhzH3y1sfiySvoAFcjVF42BfcdBuqT/5320581.json), was deployed 6 days later at a random ID 5320581 with [this image](https://reddit.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVXLrbb3ioQwrGqqXoSEkoWmznVDoPyB822cmiv3RonBm). But it was burned 2 days later. This was likely a test mint. (It was also later re-minted in a batch transaction.)
* **First real token possibly minted for a Redditor**, Coin Collectors #1, was [ID 1407989](https://reddit.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUa9n8WrJLHayVXy3VyFYgPNNvuV58q4zmUQN74dBqLfJ/1407989.json), with [this image](https://reddit.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZLKMrDf7Tib5mkNJU17e3jGhMmy1NryWoTVMwrVCbVSr). **While other tokens were all batch-minted, this one is unique in that it was single-minted.** I don't know who owns this address, but it must be someone really special since the other #1 NFTs all used batch mints. (This address also received MOONs for the first time 2 days ago, but doesn't have any activity at all.)

## On OpenSea

* Only 0.06% of the token have been listed on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/reddit-recap-2022-x-reddit-collectible-avatars) for sale.
* The most expensive sale was [Anime Kids #1](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xc8d3a3a83bde5dad06d436694e3e22ac3e64d577/4273990). That's a good-looking one, and I might just steal it.

* Cheapest one is at 0.0013 ETH or $1.50
* A total of 13 ETH has been spent on trading the tokens.

## Contract deployment gas savings

* The [Reddit Deployer](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x36fb3886cf3fc4e44d8b99d9a8520425239618c2) address responsible for deploying all the collectible avatar contracts over the past year has deployed \~150 collection contracts.
* The Recap 2022 Collectible Avatars contract was deployed by the Reddit Deployer for [586k gas](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x70d6540cfbbc6beb77821da5a885c620fdd1c33833768ba85e8f6e11fa50ee58), or $.02 of MATIC at the time. **That's insanely cheap**. Its deployment used 80% less gas than a normal-sized NFT contract.
* The reason it used less gas is because it's using an [EIP-1967 Proxy contract](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) for its implementation, which took [4.4M+ gas to deploy](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x41036773194699985fbf49a0e574c308125d4e91), currently $0.12. This is the same proxy contract that was used to deploy the other set of free NFTs we received 4 months ago.
* Since multiple avatar collections share the same logic, it makes sense for them to all reference that one Proxy Contract. Using proxies **saves gas** when deploying new collections since the gas-expensive proxy contract only needs to be deployed once and can be shared by many different collection contracts. More importantly, it also helps organize the logic of the contracts and **makes them upgradeable**. Usually calling other contracts costs more gas, but if you're using batch minting, the call cost is negligible.
* For the record, the MOONs tokens contract is also upgradeable, for better or worse.
* Equivalent EVM transactions on Polygon are still about 50-100x cheaper than on EVM-compatible Ethereum Layer 2 rollups like Arbitrum One and Optimism.",2022-12-17 18:33:25

Are you planning on buying, waiting, selling?

How long have you been in crypto? Is this your first bear market?

This will be my third bear market, and admittedly I haven’t participated and been active in both 2014 and 2018. For those that have seen more than 1 bear market we can attest how gruelling and tiresome it could get. However many always regret not sticking around.

There is no doubts that many have faced extreme losses from this past bull market and bitcoin is now trading lower than 2017’s ATH

History doesn’t repeat but it does rhyme. You’ve often heard others including yourself that “I wished I bought in 2014, 2018.” Do you think this time is different?

We are closing in on under 16 months till the next bitcoin halving 

As we are entering the “boring” capitulation phase this is exciting times for opportunities to scale in. Despite all the chaos 2022 provided, bitcoin is here to stay that won’t change

In the video you can see the officers doing a search on him and his car including his wallet which included a paper he had written his seedphrase on.

He proceeds to pull this out and unfold it on camera revealing the whole seedphrase without even knowing or understanding what it is.

It's hard to believe that a former FBI agent doesn't realize the importance of keeping your seed phrase safe and out of sight. This serves as a reminder to all of us to be extremely careful with our seed phrases and to make sure they are stored in a secure location, away from the reach of other people. You never know who might come across them and potentially gain access to your funds. 

So don't make the same mistake as this former FBI agent and risk losing access to your funds to idiocy like this even though i hope and believe he emptied the wallet as soon as he got home.",2022-12-17 18:07:58

During the crypto bear markets, things quiet down and bitcoin gears up for a new ATH (historically). Note: all of these crypto bear markets have been during a general global bull market. 

Now that we’re entering a *general* bear market, things are looking more and more bleak and yet we’re all still here. 

My question is what exactly would it take for you to abandon crypto and consider it a failed venture? 

I think if I found out that Satoshi Nakamoto was Kim Jong-Un of North Korea and it was all a ploy to take over the world that might do me in (maybe… lol). 

I honestly don’t know for me personally what it would take. Probably a new technology honestly… improved crypto, whether that incorporates blockchain or not.

Calling CZ a liar is not “FUD” it’s fact.,0,zo8z3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zo8z3g/calling_cz_a_liar_is_not_fud_its_fact/,62,1671291842.0,"A common thread among the crypto community is the complete lack of understanding of how a banking system really works. In the United States, if I were to go to Wells Fargo or any bank, and deposit $100, I have just given the bank a *loan*. The bank did not just add an asset to their balance sheet, they added a *liability*. As soon as I want to take that money back, the bank removed that loan/liability from the balance sheet.

 Now let us move to the infamous CZ of Binance. In multiple instances over the past few weeks, CZ has stated that Binance “has zero liabilities. We do not owe money to anyone” 

Now I could be wrong, but I think at least 1 person has deposited into Binance over the past 5 years. If just one person, a single person, has deposited 1 BTC; Binance has a loan liability. 

Now how can this blatant reality be reconciled with what CZ has espoused over the past month or so? 

The only conclusion, is that he is either grossly incompetent and has no business running any company, or he is lying. 

Considering the stunning mirrored behavior of CZ and SBF, it is most likely the latter. 

TLDR: intro level Econ class should allow you to see through CZ’s obvious bullshit.

Edit: I should not have dumbed down the terminology because it does matter. Client deposits are liabilities that are then used as collateral for ex nihilo loans issued by the bank.",2022-12-17 17:44:02

I know I am, because Reddit recap told me I basically spent a bazillion hours on this sub over the last year.  Also, I've taken a free $20 in USDT for leverage trading on MEXC and turned that into $20.76. I know what I'm talking about.

I am prepared to boldly claim that in the 2024-25 bull run, MOONs (the popular token of this subreddit r/cryptocurrency), will surpass $10 a coin. I've been studying the charts, doing some advanced TA, and it's super clear to me.

As we can clearly see, when we extend out the all-time chart in MS Paint, I'm able to draw a U-shape that shows MOONs going parabolic. They are 100% guaranteed to cross the $1 price point in 2024 and cross $10 in 2025.

We also see what's known as a triangle flippy-floppy, where trends get reversed and extend out to infinity. As we extend out that triangle, we make sure it fits to prove my hypothesis.

Furthermore, we see love-hearts emerging all the way up, meaning you're going to love the results as you continue FOMO'ing.

So, my friends, mis amigos, mes amies, and meine freunde, use this time to accumulate wisely.  Make shit posts. Comment shit comments on shit posts. Heck, even purchase MOONs if you have to! Invest today for a better tomorrow!

99% of coins shilled on this sub passes the Howy test as defined below:

1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With the expectation of profit
4. To be derived from the efforts of others

Certain cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) may be found to meet the definition of an ""investment contract"" under the test, especially ETH and XRP.

ETH ICO was conducted by a small group of centralised heads, VC investors, developers, as with any private company (therefore not decentralised) and carried out in Switzerland to circumvent SEC regulations. 

Now that ETH has gone PoS and has locked up billions of dollars worth of tokens for “staking”, we have a particularly odd situation where only a couple developers have the power to write the code to return the locked up funds back to retail investors. This is no different to an investment contract applied to any regulated publicly traded company.

BTC is the only cryptocurrency that is universally agreed upon (by regulators SEC and CFTC) to be a commodity. That is all. 

https://www.devere-group.com/sec-confirms-bitcoin-is-a-commodity-three-key-takeaways-for-crypto-investors/

Therefore everything else will eventually be scrutinised as a security thus the likes of Ripple, Cardano and ETH foundation will have to go public with *full* financial disclosures.

You can bet on all potential investors evaporating immediately once this happens and all the alts in the space will fall like dominoes.

Many users commented and provided their own perspectives on some of the key issues presented.

One of the pieces of feedback came from u/CryptoCrackLord who runs the atomscan website - an explorer that I linked as a source in the original post.

Together, we discussed several aspects of transparency regarding the dissemination of supply data to the public. He outlined methodology to which people could run their own tests on the node. But in the end, it was agreed that the information should be available to the public at all times and not require coding expertise to have to work it out.

Now CryptoCrackLord has updated the atomscan website to include historical and supply data. I encourage you to view the [new created statistics page of the website](https://atomscan.com/stats/blockchain).

Here is a new chart generated on the website displaying the total supply against the staked supply for the entire year. The chart, based on node data, displays very different supply data to that of Messari, Coingecko or CoinMarketcap. I'd suggest maybe adjusting the display of the X-axis if you have time, but overall the chart is incredibly useful for comparing inflation and rewards.

Overall, the feedback for the original post was generally positive, and there were many requests for me to continue providing ANTI-SHILL posts for their own investments.

Some people think the purpose of the ANTI-SHILL is to intentionally dump on cryptos. But as I outline in the posts, the intention is to get people thinking and challenging themselves.

There were a few petty grievances and relentless hate from users who targeted and downvoted me heavily, rather than challenge the data itself - this was obviously sad, but also expected.

Binance holds over 500k in BTC.
Binance has this weird ""SAFU"" program to ""protect peoples deposits"" - which is also based on BTC and BNB. Both of which are declining.
We are heading towards a recession. It's becoming clearer and clearer by the day. Thus, BTC, BNB, etc. might just not recover any significant amount anytime soon; they might even fall further. And I think we are already at a value where Binance might also be standing on their last leg.
Most importantly, the current catalyst - Mazars just halted operations. That's a massive red signpost.
To round it all off, scrutiny and the effort for scrutiny on crypto has never been as high as it is right now.
If Binance falls - and it just might upon a run right now - we are still far from the bottom here.

I'll likely come back in a couple of months - we'll see what happens with Binance until then, I suppose. But right now.. either hold your keys and accounts private, or invest in something else entirely. For now, as I see us heading towards a recession, I took the latter option.

The truth is that by purchasing decentralized digital money you can become your own bank. You can then take advantage of the many benefits it has to offer, such as low transaction fees or feeless payments for example Nano, greater transaction speed and enhanced privacy for example Monero.

There is an increasing demand that money should be decentralized; this would allow individuals within a society the ability to transact with one another in a way that is not subject to any specific governing body or system. This could potentially revolutionize the concept of money and provide individuals with more financial freedom and security.

The lack of centralization of money allows for a more equitable distribution of resources and ensures not all power is concentrated in a single entity. As such, it is beneficial for individuals to support the concept of decentralizing money.

Two of the major digital currencies today, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are seen as potential alternatives to traditional banking systems.

Bitcoin is often compared to gold due to its limited, finite supply. Its decentralized status and consensus-driven, secure nature make it an attractive asset to store value and transact without the need for a third party.

Ethereum is a revolutionary blockchain technology that has enabled its users to build and use decentralized applications powered by its native cryptocurrency -- ether, allowing anyone in the world to create trustless solutions without relying on middlemen or costly intermediaries.

Too many of us forget crypto grants us the power to be our own bankers. It's time to shake off the dust and realize what we can create with cryptocurrencies.",2022-12-17 10:56:23

Why Greyscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Is The Perfect Scam,7,zo1s8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zo1s8o/why_greyscale_bitcoin_trust_gbtc_is_the_perfect/,32,1671265543.0,"# History

At the time of writing GBTC is trading at a discount of 49%. At first this might seem like a good investment since the market price of $7.91 is way less than the value of holdings per share at $15.42. However, it is likely that GBTC will always trade at a discount as long as it remains a trust. This is because there is no way to redeem shares of the trust for Bitcoin. You might now be wondering why Grayscale doesn't redeem the shares for themselves. In the latest GBTC 10Q filing [here](https://grayscale.com/sec/) Grayscale states,

""Effective October 28, 2014, the Trust suspended its redemption program . . . out of concern that the redemption program was in violation of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, resulting in a settlement reached with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”).""

After reading the quote it might seem like Grayscale's has no choice to stop redemptions, but it's obvious that they are completely fine with this situation. For example,

""The redemption of Shares is not currently contemplated . . . Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust has not sought such relief as of the date of this Quarterly Report""

# Grayscale Doesn't Want Redemptions

Why wouldn't Grayscale try to reinstate redemptions? If you look into the structure of the trust, it makes perfect sense. If shares cannot be redeemed, then the total assets under management will not decrease unless the price of Bitcoin decreases. The only way for an investor in GBTC to get their money back is to sell their shares on the secondary market which does not affect the assets under management. This means that Grayscale continues to earn the 2% yearly fees they charge to manage the 10.7 billion dollars in Bitcoin. That's around 214 million dollars per year at the current Bitcoin price, just to hold the Bitcoin. Grayscale does not have to ever worry about assets under management decreasing due to redemptions and earns a guaranteed income of 2% of the Bitcoin every year.

# Only Grayscale Wins

Those with shares are forced to hold shares hoping the GBTC etf is approved which allows the discount to be closed without effecting the net asset value. The GBTC etf was already rejected by the SEC so it is unlikely to happen in the near term. The only other option for shareholders is to sell at a loss on the secondary market further increasing the discount as there is not much demand for GBTC shares. Grayscale continues to make the money holding Bitcoin that can't be withdrawn by anyone else.

# Closing

Sadly, Grayscale has this same model for all of its different trusts. Most of them trade below their holdings per share because shares can't be redeemed. Most of these trusts require barely any management but Grayscale still makes hundreds of millions in fees.

If you see anything I got wrong don't be afraid to point it out :)

# TLDR

GBTC makes hundreds of millions from the GBTC discount every year

By maintenance, I don't mean buying and selling, do that as you like. But instead, make sure, you have all your private keys in place, all your 2fa set up, do an inventory of everything you have. Most people just track their delta app, but do you actually know the addresses for all your coins in your portfolio? Is your hardware wallet up to date? Did some coins have an update and you need to do something to keep them? It's so easy to forget about that mobile wallet you set up a few months or years ago. Do you still have access to these coins? Check it and if needed transfer to a safe wallet. 

My example? 3 years ago, I messed around a bit with a passphrase on my ledger. For those who don't know, it let's you add a 25th word as extra security which gives access to a completely separate set of public addresses than your 24 words. Guess what, I tried it out, decided it's too much of a hassle and left it after trying. Just what I forgot was to transfer the few coins I tested it with back to my main addresses. So this week,I checked my addresses and noticed, I don't have access to these coins anymore. By pure luck I was able to remember the passphrase I tried out 3 years ago to regain access to my coins in the separate addresses.",2022-12-17 09:54:08

The vast majority of Top 100 (market cap) coins from 5 years ago vanished from the Top 100 [Data/Graphs],101,znz2g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znz2g6/the_vast_majority_of_top_100_market_cap_coins/,63,1671254995.0,"Had a little free time tonight and felt like playing with some rudimentary data. I pulled up historical pricing/market cap data from CoinMarketCap, specifically to the date of December 17th, 2017 (five years ago). I very briefly looked at what coins were in the Top 100 by market cap in 2017 and how that compared to today's Top 100 list.

It's not pretty, folks, much to no one's surprise.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 1 - 78 of 100 Top 100 coins from 2017 are no longer in the Top 100 \(by market cap\)](https://preview.redd.it/h1h5gyb65e6a1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=791eadd26d92b7fed21203cd7371787845027530)

&#x200B;

Figure 1 kinda says it all - based on market cap, the vast majority of Top 100 coins from 2017 are no longer in the Top 100 in 2022. Specifically, 78 of 100 coins have vanished. A few of those have actually completely disappeared e.g. BitConnect, but many others e.g. NANO (I miss you my sweet prince) still exist, but have just fallen from grace (you can find NANO at rank #219 these days).

We can break this down a little further. For example, of the 22 coins that heled onto their Top 100 listing, where were they in 2017? I've split up the Top 100 in to pentiles (batches of 20).

&#x200B;

[Fig. 2 - Of the 22 coins that remained in the Top 100 from 2017 to 2022, 15 of those were in the Top 20 in 2017.](https://preview.redd.it/wgblic246e6a1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=678ea37379bad2c0894d27d774002c6f65935421)

By splitting up the coins into groups of 20, we can see that 15 of the 22 coins that were in the Top 100 in 2017 and remained in the Top 100 in 2022 were actually in the Top 20. Only 3 coins from rank 21 to 40 stayed in the Top 2022, 2 coins from 41 to 60, and 1 coin each from groups 61 to 80 (MANA) and 81 to 100 (LINK).

I studied human nutrition in college, and one of my professors one made this analogy: bone density is like paragliding, where you want to start high up at the beginning, because you'll be going down as you age. Basically, get your bones as strong as they can be in your teens and 20s because further building of bone density is difficult after age 30. Just like bones and paragliding, if your crypto starts near the top, it'll take longer in most cases to fall out of favor.

So, what happened to those 15 coins in the Top 20? What about the other Top 100 coins that remained in the Top 100? Did they fall or rise within the Top 100? Let's look at a simple table.

&#x200B;

[Table 1 - The market cap rank of each of the 22 coins that were in the Top 100 in 2017 and remained in the Top 100 in 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/an9glgz09e6a1.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=3480127e63c6a99b3095ea804c65dfb7ba07f0d3)

The two numbered columns show the market cap rank of the coin on that line in 2017 and in 2022. For example, BCH was ranked #3 in 2017 and is now ranked #26 in 2022. Coins highlighted in YELLOW did not change rank from 2017 to 2022. Coins highlighted in GREEN actually GAINED positions from 2017 to 2022 (shout out to LINK, which moved up 70 spots from #91 to #21). All other coins, shown in WHITE, lost rankings, with the largest drop being XEM which dropped 84 positions from #9 to #93.  


If you look carefully, you'll see that 15 of the top 16 coins from 2017 are still on the Top 100, but #11 from 2017 is missing from the 2022 Top 100 list. Which shitcoin fell all the way from #11 to off of the Top 100? That honor goes to **Bitcoin Gold (BTG)** which is now ranked #117, falling a flaccid 106 positions in the last five years.

Now, it's important to keep in mind that market cap isn't the end-all-be-all of a coin's value, monetarily or functionally. This is mostly just a bit of fun I wanted to have, and maybe a small reminder that many coins can fall out of favor, even solid alts with seemingly worth-while use cases. Perhaps some data to keep in mind the next time you considering DCAing.",2022-12-17 07:29:55

Lets say in this scenario there is also a 5 year vesting period on the team & seed round tokens, which is only 1 year in.

How is there such a decline in price if the team wasn't selling off their treasury?   

&nbsp;

Are VC's just dumping everything that unlocks from the vesting schedule to get out of the bear market, while the order books are illiquid, causing a very low price range?  

&nbsp;

Would much appreciate some thoughts & insights!

Buckle into your seat belts for the opportunity of a lifetime,260,znwlym,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znwlym/buckle_into_your_seat_belts_for_the_opportunity/,686,1671246334.0,"We are entering the final phase of the bear market. Those that can flip the switch emotionally will look at this opportunity and load the boat.

I’m sure many have seen the cycles chart but those who survive and wait out the next 12-18 months deserve the glory of the bull market. In this chart we are past the panic stage and now heading into anger. Good news is now is the opportunity of a lifetime to plan positions and scale in the next year.

For those who missed 2014, 2018 and the black swan event of 2020 March - don’t make an excuse this time, the train is coming back to the station. I was around in 2014 when the sentiment was 10x worse - if bitcoin can survive that it will succeed.

2023 will go down as one of the best years to historically buy crypto and assets. We went from an extreme case of Quantitative Easing (money printer going brrrr) to Quantitative tightening. These affects usually take 12-24 months to filter through the system. 

Unfortunately the economy isn’t doing well and likely to continue into 2023. We’re not heading for a soft landing - neither is inflation going to the target 2%. The fed is determined to get there - however the many signs point to peak inflation being 9.1% in June 2022 and likely by June 2024 we will be at 3-4% inflation 

There are three stages of the fed pivot that we are seeing signs of entering :

Stage 1 - Slow down of the interest rate hike 

Stage 2 - Pausing if the interest hikes

Stage 3 - Reversal of interest rates 

Historically unemployment in QT and recessions have hit 5.5-7% and we are currently at 3.7% - we have a long way to go. We started seeing mass layoffs in tech and that will happen for the wider economy. Businesses and consumers are tightening their wallets and this will continue to have an impact 

The market tends to bottom before the reversal of interest rates - which will likely come after the second half of 2023 at this pace

Crypto truly is following its past cycles like a book. This cycle corresponds damn almost perfect to the 2024 halving. 

The worst thing you can do is leave the bear market and not build positions, you owe it to yourself to stay disciplined and at the very least do nothing. No one can time the bottom however these prices will be deemed “lucky” by those who join in 2025+",2022-12-17 05:05:34
Teaching mom all about bitcoin,5,znwaod,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znwaod/teaching_mom_all_about_bitcoin/,45,1671245283.0,"My mom said she wanted ""a bitcoin"" for Christmas, really I think she just wants to know how the whole thing works. I haven't used bitcoin for a long time and was surprised to find I still had some in some old files. So, I consolidated what I had and set up a wallet for her using python.   


But, as I was testing I discovered it's a lot harder to move bitcoin around without logging in to some service or sharing a photo ID. I'm guessing this is the impact of legislation and or people and companies getting burned. I'm curious, though, if it's possible still to make a transfer without logging in to a service that requires ID verification?  


Alternately, and this is going deeper than what I did before, which was just using a python bitcoin library, but if I have miner can I use it as a peer to get my transaction into the blockchain?  


I've read through all the stuff about how to format and encode a transaction, and then it needs to be passed to a peer... so would having a miner of my own running be a way to do that?

The Binance FUD has been going on for over a week now.

FTX stopped collapsed in less than three days.

I'm not rooting for a Monopoly to win, or hold BNB or anything. But this FUD on Binance feels like it has been going on forever now. From the day that CZ tweeted about selling his FTX tokens, to filing for bankruptcy, it was only about three days.

But with Binance, withdrawals haven't stopped, people are seeing the same delay messages that have always appeared, and still reporting that their funds arrive within a much shorter time frame.

The drainage is big for sure, almost $4bn, but it pails in comparison to the $60bn they hold in cold wallets. And it's only $1.5bn more than they handled when FTX collapsed.

Compare the outflows to FTX and you'll see Binance absolutely drawfs the FTX capabilities. They processed significantly more outflows in the previous months than during this attack.

Here's a graph from The Block Research showing the outflows of Ethereum on Binance. More money was pulled out when FTX crashed than right now.

Still from time to time people say their positions are too small to withdraw. While this was a valid excuse last year, it isn't today though.

The [Bitcoin mempool](https://mempool.space/de/) gets cleared at least every few hours. This means even transactions at 1 sat/vB get confirmed within short time. That's less than **0.03$ per standard transaction** (1 input, 2 outputs).

Even the [ETH fees](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) are at 16 gwei while I'm writing this. This correspond to a fee of **0.40$ for a ETH transfer**, and **1$ for a token transfer**.

Other networks are in general even cheaper than these two.

Even though hw-wallets are prefered, for small amounts hot wallets can be an acceptable way to store your crypto. For maximum security you can even delete the wallet from the PC while it's not used as long as you have and keep the seed stored well.

So despite all turbulences on the market, getting your crypto out of exchanges is as cheap as it can get, and there is no valid excuse to not withdraw even smaller amounts.",2022-12-17 04:35:16

In the case of B.N.B it is the main linchpin in an entire ecosystem. By just going down it is wrecking havoc in them. Secondly it's used as collateral against leveraged positions. Eventually it will hit a point of no return were we get a cascade followed by a bounce then capitulation 

Based off just the chart I would say this is around ~$200.00 per-coin 

Obviously you would need to know the sizes and liquidations across hundreds of assets to get the real number. So in truth the only people who would know would be insiders with high level clearance. 

However the biggest warning sign is if the CEX suddenly goes down or in a more desperate move they literally halt the chain ( they can and have done this).

BNB Token is tanking.

Binance and CZ have been on the defensive due to the failing of the FTX exchange and their role in its demise. I don’t blame CZ’s tweet for taking down FTX, but it was the nail in the coffin for me to remove all my assets from the FTX platform. SBF literally lent out all the customer funds to Alameda is a giant clusterf*** of loans to executives and crappy bets. CZ just wanted his actual money from his investment in FTX from early on. No one can fault him for that. Just sucks that the bank run on FTX caused all the liquidity to dry up.

Point two is that MAZARS was performing a proof of reserves for several crypto exchanges and has now decided to stop all work on this. I’m wondering why they all of the sudden decided it’s not in their best interest? They must be well paid for this and maybe they’ve uncovered something that they can’t verify or they don’t want to risk their reputation for something. I’m not really sure. 

The third point is the fact that the BNB token is crashing in value. I don’t know enough to really see where the money is here, but the outflows from Binance have been significant. They had to halt trading/redemptions this week because supposedly they needed to do a swap through a US bank that wasn’t open yet. The BNB token crashing in value is probably due to all the news and FUD, and redemptions. 

The things going on since the FTX collapse have been insane and I can’t stop watching. I’m not ready to say get your assets off the Binance exchange, but it’s awfully suspicious.",2022-12-17 03:17:23

The problem I have with this comparison is that, unlike the banks, Binance is not a bank. 

Binance, from what I can gather is more like a crypto focused combination of an exchange (NYSE or CME), a brokerage (Schwab, Hood or IBKR), and whatever you want to compare their role in their branded tokens to in the ""fiat"" world.

In order to gain confidence and credibility, in the absence of the protections and transparencies embedded in the above comparable companies, should he not be referring to those types of competitors?

Personally, I find it highly unlikely that this emperor is fully clothed, but his attempts to convince me otherwise have been way off the mark in my eyes and he has probably given me less confidence in the company than he would have had he simply stayed relatively quiet.

Not that it impacts me all that much right now. I lost a few k with FTX, cashed out my last 15k on Binance and Coinbase at the same time, and consider myself lucky to be completely out of crypto at this point having had a very good run over the years!",2022-12-17 02:37:39

Then he sent me an email with a passcode and asked me to verify it, which I did.  Then they sent a text to me which included an external link which started with [//cb-relink.com/?email=](//cb-relink.com/?email=)""my email address"".  Here is where it got phishy.  The text was from 802-368-5282, and was blocked by my text spam filter. It directed me to a link which also was blocked by my chrome spam filter. 

I asked for a call back number so I could verify some things before proceeding and he said that is the purpose of the call and I couldn't call back.  Now my spidey sense was really tingling.  I said I needed to think about it and told me I was on an android in my current city, and that should be all the verification that was needed.  So I hung up.  He called back about 15 min later, which I ignored.  Go to check my coinbase account, no new transactions or alerts or anything.

• Regulatory intervention: If governments around the world decide to crack down on cryptocurrency and impose strict regulations or bans on its use, it could lead to a drop in demand and a crash in the market. 

• Security breaches: If major cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets experience security breaches or hacks, it could lead to a loss of confidence in the market and a significant drop in the value of cryptocurrencies. 

• Market manipulation: If a small group of individuals or organizations are able to manipulate the market through tactics such as wash trading or spoofing, it could lead to a crash in the market as other investors lose confidence in the integrity of the market.

Now i do want to get back into the market asap. But i dread being my own bank. I am well in my 40 s. Dont do well with computerstuff ( still type with 2 fingers). 

But i will do it anyways. So i m getting a ledger tomorrow and will start with small buys again and some transactions to learn this stuff frist. And the reinvest everything.

So long ass story to get to simple question. ( old people do that)As i get a ledger is it safe to get the expensive one with Bluetooth or is it safer to get one without.

Why a DCA will actually beat the average price.,12,znsfdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znsfdv/why_a_dca_will_actually_beat_the_average_price/,43,1671233565.0,"I have seen [someone claiming](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znps4z/dont_fall_into_the_dca_trick/) a DCA will ""only"" give you an average price, and almost no one here even questioned this statement. But the truth is, your DCA will always perform better than the average price. To demonstrate this principle I made a small exmaple:

Let's assume a hypothetical DCA of 500$ per month of MaxxCoin with arbitrary pricing:

&#x200B;

||Price|Buy|Spent|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Month 1|10,000 $|0.05|500 $|
|Month 2|5,000 $|0.1|500 $|
|Month 3|2,500 $|0.2|500 $|
|Month 4|5,000 $|0.1|500 $|
|Month 5|2,500 $|0.2|500 $|
|Total|Ø 5,000 $|0.65|2500 $|

In this example the average price is 5000$. But you acquired 0.65 MaxxCoin for 2500$, which means your average price was \~3,846 $.

Why is this happening? Your DCA isn't doing a normal average. You would get a normal average if you would buy the same amount of crypto every time. But since you are keeping your fiat amount constant, it automatically weights the buys at low prices stronger than those at high prices.

**So don't be afraid to ""fall into the DCA Trick""**. The DCA Trick is what will make you survive this bear market.",2022-12-17 01:32:45

Safemoon returns people's stolen V1 tax tokens...

---

For those not in the know, you lucky fuckers, on December 29th 2021 Safemoon LLC started to steal Safemoon & BNB tokens when you tried to buy, sell, swap or transfer Safemoon.

[This resulted in the theft of $5m across more than 50,000 holders, as measured by me on April 26th 2022.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uigey5/4899739_a_complete_view_of_the_safemoon_v1_100/)

Today, it appears Safemoon wish to make penance with this literal daylight robbery and have finally, after almost literally an entire fucking year, [built something to allow holders that got ripped off to get their tokens back.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/981149242007638016/1053420855503368262/IMG_6143.png)  


#EXCEPT THOSE TOKENS ARE WORTH 86% LESS THAN THEY WERE A YEAR AGO!


And the catch? By receiving your stolen funds back, you waive any right to prosecute Safemoon for losses or compensation in court!!!  

> By participating in this Migration Completion Program, and by checking this box, you agree that by virtue of establishing, developing, and implementing this Migration Completion Program, SafeMoon does not admit any legal liability with respect to the V1 to V2 migration, including without limitation, liability under any securities, consumer protection, or other statutory or regulatory provision, or any provision of the common law of any jurisdiction, or breach of contract.  


So let's recap.  

* Safemoon build a V2 contract for no discernible purpose other than to be able to give themselves 1% of every transaction.
* Safemoon do not communicate properly or in a timely fashion how to migrate properly or the perils of not migrating properly
* Safemoon warn people of a 100% token tax, 1.5 hours before they implement it
* Safemoon ignore tens of thousands of people and happily withdraw the $5m taxed proceeds that end up in the liquidity pool
* After a year, the token is worth 86% less, but you will be grate for your fucking tokens and don't you dare even think about taking us to court for hijacking your shit for a year.

Opinion: ETH won't flip BTC,2,znr7ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znr7ia/opinion_eth_wont_flip_btc/,86,1671230280.0,"Remember the ""Flippening"" ? I remember. The idea was, that ETH will one day flip BTC, because utility, burning, adoption, lower mcap, sound money and other shilling points.

After the long awaited MERGE, where everything was on the line and the merge was successful, we are exactly in the same place we were regarding price movement and market cap. ETH hasn't moved an inch. 

Right now BTC mcap is 324 compared to 144 of ETH's. This means that ETH is 0.44 mcap of BTC. Before merge about one year ago BTC was at 960 mil, while ETH was at 488 mil so ETH was 0.51 mcap of BTC. Now its even lower than before. 

The MERGE was one of the most expected and risky situations of ETH history and it went flawless. We are still heading for an update where users will be able to unstake ETH and sell it. This means more sell pressure as people have been led on by the ETH merge for 3 years. Threats of ETH being a security, censorship with POS... brings more uncertainty.

With all this in mind, I don't think there will ever be a FLIPPENINNG. Bull markets will come, prices will go up, but sadly ETH won't flip BTC.

Avatar trading tips from a random redditor,2,znql8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znql8q/avatar_trading_tips_from_a_random_redditor/,58,1671228659.0,"Most people with a reddit account received an avatar and everyone wants to know what is the potential value of their avatar so here are a few tips on how collectors assign value:

1. **Scarcity matters**. If your avatar is 1 of 100, it is more scarce than 1 of 1000 so that gets a premium.
2. **Bling Factor matters**. Is your avatar visually appealing? Would you want to display it as your profile? If yes, other people will too. There is always a premium on pretty.
3. **The market decides what your avatar is worth, not you.** The highest offer today may be $20 but next week it could be double or half that.
4. **Play the game.** Did someone offer you less than you feel your avatar is worth? Make a counter-offer. They may agree to your counter offer or counter again.
5. **Mint# matters.** Low mint numbers carry more value because they are more difficult to obtain and more scarce than higher-digit mint #'s.

\---Bummed about not having a low mint#?  No worries, your mint# may still carry value to collectors if it contains any of the following traits:

***Meme-ability***: 69 or 420 or 666 or 69420

***Ladder***: 12345 or 54321 or 9876543

***Palindrome*** (also called radar): 123321 or 12588521

***Solids:*** 111111 or 5555 or 99999

***Repeaters***: 12231223 or 123123123

***Anniversaries***: 741776 = 7/4/1776 = the US independence day

***Mistakes/over-mints:*** A mint# that is 1001 of 1000

The market for these avatars is new but it follows patterns similar to the market for collectible printed money (serial numbers).

My guess is they aren't really NFTs, and if they are real, I would like to trace the transactions to see where they went. Anyone here have this info or know how I can find it? I'm not familiar with Polygon enough to figure this out myself but I believe that you can't transfer Polygon NFTs across wallets (which is dumb).

Would something like this even show up on the Blockchain or is this a custodial account issue where there's no transparency so we can't see it happening on the Blockchain?

As we can see on this chart, this bear market has now officially taken longer to form a bottom than in 2018, where it happened in just about a year. There are also a ton of other metrics suggesting that this bear market has been proportionally bigger and longer than the bear market in 2018.

This obviously shows in what kind of an extraordinary situation BTC is, it can very well be argued that we are in a way worse spot than BTC was in 2018. We had tens of big entities in crypto fail this year, under which were the billion dollar scams of LUNA and FTX.

This, right now, is truly an exceptional bear market with the crypto playfield being cleansed of billion-dollar scams and thus a survivor of this will be exceptional too. Hang in there.",2022-12-16 19:50:11

I want to make a small parallel and tell you **how hard it is to see something in advance** and why you might risk sounding crazy when you speak about it

&#x200B;

I was very active in Dogecoin community and subreddit long before it reached these levels of hype. At this point r/cc was not very active and it was fun moon talking on Doge sub. **People were very confused what was goal, $0.01? $0.1? $1?  They didn't understand marketcap and Dogecoin inflation or supply**. So 1doge = 1doge meme brought in lot of consfusion, is it 1doge = 1doge or 1Dogecoin = 1 Shib Dog = $800, fun times

**Devs were active on the sub and were telling people not to carry themself away** and dream of even $0.01

Doge, **price at the time of writing this comment:  $0.000385** 

[Doge](https://preview.redd.it/at7pwzr1t36a1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db9167cbbb867b491f453c7efbe077bb4d7d9a7)

**Moons, price at the time of writing this comment : $0.10**

[Moons](https://preview.redd.it/l7iq7db1u36a1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a40e176080101b6088c3fcc31d0d72ff752724c)

Same thing is happening with Moons, people find it hard to imagine that Moons can reach **$10,** even if it would **only need $1.09b mcap at current supply.** Doge ATH mcap was $90b, SHIB ATH mcap was $40b

&#x200B;

* Owning **1225 Dogecoins is equal to owning 1 Moon** at current supply in terms of percentage

1 Moon / 109 000 000 x 100 = 0.000000917

x/ 133 670 764 300 x 100 = 0.000000917

x = 0.000000917/100 \* 133 670 764 300

x= 1225

**10 Moons = 12,250 Dogecoins**

**100 Moons = 122,500 Dogecoins**

Pretty crazy how much scarcer Moons are and how **mcap needed for Moons to reach $1 is miniscule in comparission to Doge** $109m vs $133b, yet some are still sceptical

&#x200B;

* **Mcap price comparison:**

 If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **Dogecoin**'**s**  **ATH** market cap of **$90.B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$825$**  upside of 825x

 If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **Dogecoin**'s bear market cap of **$11.8B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$108.92**, an upside of **1224x** 

**Now watch this**: SHIB was born from Doge success and :

&#x200B;

> If r/CryptoCurrency **Moons** had **1/100** of **Shiba Inu**'s **BEAR market cap** of **$5.2B**, 1 MOON would be worth **$4.7**, an upside of **54x** **!**

&#x200B;

Now imagine what Moons can do, with Reddit betting big on crypto and **Reddit CEO saying he would like the subreddits to be business** and people to generate wealth on reddit, **future big exchanges listings**, possibly integrating Moons in new NFT Marketplace and next bullrun which will bring bottom mcap for legit projects higher than last bullrun's 300m

Moons have huge potential! And we might look back at these days and possibility to earn this many in a round will be looked like mining BTC in early days on your PC. Future is exciting for Moons and as BTC of social tokens and reddit pushing and leading the web3, **we gonna see some amazing things!**

Is anyone else building their own crypto index fund?,3,znjpy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znjpy5/is_anyone_else_building_their_own_crypto_index/,32,1671210739.0,"Basically I am building my own simplified crypto ETF/index fund portfolio and I'm curious if anyone else is doing the same.

I simply took the top 30 crypto by market cap, filtered out stablecoins & a few coins I don't believe in. I also heavily downgraded Bitcoin, other non smart-contracts coins (DOGE, LTC, SHIB...) and centralized projects (XRP, BNB...). And slightly upgraded a few smaller coins I like (Chainlink, Arweave, LRC...)

So my portfolio ends up looking something like: 70% ETH, 5% BTC, 3.5% MATIC, 3% DOT, 1.8% AVAX... with about 20 coins in total.

My plan is to keep the same downgrade/upgrade levels and periodically rebalance depending on where the market caps and prices take me. Otherwise, just DCA & HODL.

The idea is to minimize risk by investing in the broader market. This way, for example, if some ""ETH killer"" actually ends up beating ETH (and I do believe this to be unlikely atm), I should not be left out on the sidelines. And it should also prevent me from overbuying some soon-to-die ""ETH killer"" that may be looking good now.

I am aware there are some limitations: 

* Without downgrading BTC, the portfolio would be 60% BTC & 28% ETH
* Inefficiencies while rebalancing (basically you can end up selling low and buying high when rebalancing)
* I'm still adding personal decisions to the portfolio so it's really not an ""index fund""

But given that ETFs are the preferred way of investing for the long term in normal stocks, why not try to do the same in crypto. Am I the only doing this?

Disclaimer: I am building a simple web app that will help me (and maybe others if I'm not alone doing this) keep track of my portfolio better than through excel sheets. Cause it currently sucks doing this on excel lol",2022-12-16 19:12:19

This was done by controlling the vast majority of coins in their own projects, like SRM token where they used more than the existing circulating supply to inflate their assets and manufacture collateral.

It begs the question on whether other big exchanges are using similar tactics.  One which strikes me as particularly suspicious is Bitfinex and the LEO Token.  LEO Token is listed as a $3.4B market cap:

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/leo-token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/leo-token)

If we check DefiLlama, we can see Bitfinex's total crypto assets' value is $4.56B:

[https://defillama.com/cexs](https://defillama.com/cexs)

LEO is quite an anomaly on the charts.  Most coins with $1B+ market cap have hundreds of millions in daily trade volume... LEO has less than $1M.  Further, if we look at the concentration of ownership, it's even more bizarre:

[https://etherscan.io/token/0x2af5d2ad76741191d15dfe7bf6ac92d4bd912ca3#balances](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2af5d2ad76741191d15dfe7bf6ac92d4bd912ca3#balances)

Bitfinex controls \~99% of the existing supply on 2 of their addresses.  Basically, this is a top 25 coin that is virtually non-existent outside of Bitfinex.  And it trades in incredibly small volumes.

So immediately it begs the questions...

* Why does Bitfinex control 99% of the existing LEO supply?
* Is LEO being used as collateral or in other ways to manipulate their balance sheet?
* What is the point of printing so many LEO tokens if they are just going to be owned and held by the issuer?

I'm not specifically accusing Bitfinex of anything.  But to say they've had a troubled past is putting it lightly.  They were the victim of a massive hack in 2016.  They are deeply intertwined with the Tether project.  They took a loan from Tether to maintain solvency.

Why you SHOULD talk about crypto (but responsibly): The story of an elderly lady who was scammed three times by the same people.,32,znheqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znheqe/why_you_should_talk_about_crypto_but_responsibly/,47,1671204905.0,"I see a lot of posts about not talking to family members or friends about cryptocurrencies, but in some cases, even that silence could be harmful. It's important to be able to have honest conversations about this industry, or else you could be leading someone to invest irresponsibly or hiding the dangers of the many scams that exist.

I worked with a woman in her late 60s who was on the brink of retirement. During last year's bull market, she came into work one day talking about how she hired a financial advisor who specialized in  crypto to help her gain even more interest on her retirement. I initially warned her to be careful with her money because there are a lot of sharks that take advantage of the lack of regulations. The advisor provided elaborate P/L invoices on a weekly basis, and she would share screenshots of them on her phone. She came in every day shooting finger guns and talking about how we were ""cryptopals.""

It was a fun few weeks until she came in quietly one morning. I asked if everything was okay, and she said that the financial advisor from the firm that she was working with told her that she needed to pay 30% of her initial investment in order to withdraw her funds. I asked for more information and she said she was working with a cloud mining company (red flag) called BiddersCopy (their site has since been deactivated). I asked where she heard about the company and she said from a friend of a friend on Facebook (another red flag). The more I asked about the company, the grimmer the situation seemed. In the end, I had to tell this woman that she was being scammed out of her retirement funds. I advised her that I only DCA into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by marketcap, and she should stick to major exchanges for her investments.

I wish the story stopped there. A few months later she informed me that she was waiting on her funds. At first I was happy for her and ready to eat my words. Then she told me more. She'd come to a deal where she only had to pay an initial 20% of her investment instead of the 30%, and now she only needed to pay for the taxes on her profits. My expression must've said it all, because I could see the blood rush from her face. This time I clearly told her not to give them any more of her money because generally no one asks you to pay taxes to unlock profits from an investment; if anything, they would simply deduct the taxes from the profits as they were returned. She said that if this was a scam, she'd be ruined financially. She was considering taking out a loan to help pay the taxes so she could get her investment back. I told her that her investment was probably gone.

She was really down for a few months. She started avoiding me entirely, which made me feel pretty shitty. But one day I came into work and she was in really good spirits. She said that a blockchain detective reached out to her after ""finding her name in a database."" She said she was paying for his services to help recuperate her investment. Tbh, I don't even remember how I responded the last time, but I told her she was being scammed by the same people. She asked if I could help her with her investments, to which I replied with a clear, unambiguous ""no,"" but I was happy to share my resources with her.

This lady was scammed 3 times out of her money by the same people. I can't act like her own greed didn't play a hand in her own undoing, but if she'd had family that was honest about the risk of crypto, I don't think that she'd find herself in that situation without some skepticism. I have a feeling that I was the only one telling her to be cautious in this situation, and I was only her coworker. This is why these conversations are important.

If I talk to my family about cryptocurrencies, I try to talk about both the strengths and weaknesses of the industry, instead of shilling my favorite projects and preaching about an idealistic financial revolution. Please make sure that, if you discuss these things to your friends and family, that you let them know any potential risks that you can think of, especially if they're elderly or in a situation where they're susceptible to being scammed. I understand that the scammers are ultimately the only culprits in this situation, but a lot of things went wrong in this situation that could've prevented the outcome.

TLDR: This old lady was scammed out of her retirement funds thrice by the same scammers, and it may not have happened if people around her were having responsible conversations about cryptocurrencies.",2022-12-16 17:35:05

BTC the POW of its own PoW,0,zngv25,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zngv25/btc_the_pow_of_its_own_pow/,40,1671203456.0,"Proof of Work (PoW) is a burden for BTC, more of that after ETH's smooth sailing into PoS and energy price surge bought by Russia invasion. The arguments are:

**Energy Use**

* Wasting Energy is simply unnecessary and unscalable. It does not help that banking are spending more energy than BTC PoW - how many people are banks serving now vs BTC? How much more energy does BTC PoW need to serve these users? It also does not help that many BTC miners are using renewable energy - that renewable energy is still badly needed for other purposes. 

**Decentralization**

* BTC miners are dominated by a few public entities, which is comparable to ETH staker concentration. Worse is that anyone can buy ETH to join stake pool, but BTC miners are purely experts' job now

**Chain Security**

* It's true that BTC has >12 yrs operating history. But there are dozens of PoS chains operating perfectly securely since 2018, and now with the mighty ETH joining the camp, PoS security will be further validated. As time goes by, PoW's long operating history is no longer an advantage

**Technology Advance**

* Crypto still has to stay in the cutting edge of technology to compete against fiat. But guys, any technology advance from PoW camp in the last a few years? No. Do anyone believe people will forever worship BTC as Gold just because it's the first Crypto?

In summary, BTC PoW does not offer meaningful advantage vs ETH PoS, but reduced BTC into at best a wealth storage, at worst worthless. Why could anyone use ETH for transaction only BUT hold BTC as wealth? Sorry they simply could not be decoupled - if it's money, it has to used for transactions. Otherwise it's souvenir and does not deserve to have the largest market cap. Saylor might be right that there is no second best, but he surely failed to realize that the best is NOT locked to BTC.

BTC already becomes POW of its own PoW!",2022-12-16 17:10:56

As crypto continues to grow, this is slowly becoming a thing of the past. The rise of platforms like Ocean Protocol is a clear example of how people are being given more freedom and rights when it comes to their personal data. This also allows personal data to be monetized by its rightful owners.

Does GitHub activity affect crypto prices?,3,zneta2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zneta2/does_github_activity_affect_crypto_prices/,17,1671197659.0,"Most likely not. 

However, here is the data so you can make your own decision.

&#x200B;

As a software developer, I have worked on a few startups and crypto projects. It seemed to me that whenever the business is slower or there are some difficulties, less code is committed. There may be a number of reasons for that, such as fewer developers, weaker motivation, or no urgent bug fixes, etc.

I am absolutely aware that the number of commits by itself is not a perfect metric for the code quality or the speed of development.

&#x200B;

However, I was intrigued enough to investigate.

&#x200B;

Here are some interesting graphs: 

&#x200B;

[Bitcoin ](https://preview.redd.it/rcl3cs1lz86a1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=828702e4347bb5fe00f81f6f1681baab70ef8b97)

&#x200B;

[Ada ](https://preview.redd.it/2vw1wi9uz86a1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=48a094dbf187db58c493d36c589bd59bfa64bb15)

&#x200B;

[Doge ](https://preview.redd.it/jgxt9ipvz86a1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=66d4a37c7b3284865d9089c19a099c32ed1ac1e4)

There seems to be no consistent relation between GitHub commits and the price of crypto assets. 

To test whether there is any relation, I have backtested a number of trading strategies.

&#x200B;

[GitHub commits and coin price](https://preview.redd.it/ntbu2puz096a1.png?width=2202&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe64a1a4806e884f09c80a9e507d39d13b96a0a)

The graph shows the average profits at different points in time if $100 was invested every month when the number of commits to a coin's GitHub repository was greater (blue) or lower (orange) in the last month compared to the preceding month.

Data was calculated for the crypto assets with the largest market cap and active public repository: BTC, ETH, ADA, DOGE, and MATIC.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the best-performing strategies:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4s29c9z1196a1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad6e90d42a6f8b04e0055f625acc0e094304ac07

Every month, if the number of commits on GitHub is down for Bitcoin (BTC) by 30% compared to the average from the previous month, then buy $100 of Bitcoin (BTC).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bvv7t473196a1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf87c52cc1542ef225e35c9b88bf1273f96eeb48

Every month, if the number of commits on GitHub is up for Ethereum (ETH) by 30% compared to the average from the previous month, then buy $100 of Ethereum (ETH).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2j8bpf4196a1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc060c80b03ad2cc7e1e383e8a57295b61ab176d

Every month, if the number of commits on GitHub is up for Cardano (ADA) by 30% compared to the average from the previous month, then buy $100 of Cardano (ADA).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/guwvtpi5196a1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5aedf9e78777210d07c545eafa0a04c448e387

Every month, if views on Wikipedia are down for Ripple (XRP) by 20% compared to the average from the previous month, then buy $100 of Ripple (XRP).

&#x200B;

The profits in the above strategies might be explained by the fact that some of those strategies bought crypto currencies early, while the benchmark buys an equal amount every month. 

&#x200B;

These findings seem to be consistent with this article:[ https://research.thetie.io/does-github-activity-affect-crypto-prices/](https://research.thetie.io/does-github-activity-affect-crypto-prices/).

Most of this Binance FUD is baseless and silly. Everyone should always self custody bitcoin or any coins they're not trading with but don't be naive that there aren't people with ill intentions right now,86,znemhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znemhm/most_of_this_binance_fud_is_baseless_and_silly/,96,1671197106.0,"Some personal observations and trying to establish some facts around Binance FUD, a lot of which is deliberately misleading either due to not being well informed or malice. SBF's official paid spokesperson Kevin O'Leary seems to be behind most of it.

24 hours before SBF arrest, [the Block and Wall Street Journal](https://nitter.it/krugermacro/status/1602478325024391170) rehashed an old 2018 investigation into Binance out of the blue at the exact same time. Reuters then ran with it too but at least made sure to clarify the investigation is from 2018 and nothing new.

The investigation concerns Iranian firms using Binance. Kraken was also accused of it recently. Just last month, Binance's compliance team [froze Iranian assets](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2022/11/05/Binance-says-crypto-moved-through-platform-from-bad-actors-in-Iran-) and blocked concerned accounts for violation of US sanctions. These restrictions around US sanctions only apply to Binance US.

Few days ago, an article was shared here from CNBC titled 'Binance suspended withdrawals for USDC', but the article didn't at all mention that Binance autoconverts all USDC to BUSD since September. There was also a scheduled maintenance which Binance already notified users of over a week ago. Publications without ulterior motives can also be misleading if journalists aren't responsible enough to research thoroughly what they're writing about.

Again in a [CNBC interview yesterday](https://youtu.be/uwsJm3qgp9I), the hosts brought it up not knowing how stablecoins work. Mainstream journalists don't seem to know that unlike legacy fractional reserve system, assets are required to be backed 1:1 by crypto exchanges and there are no bailouts in bitcoin. After writing puff pieces, coddling SBF and destroying their reputations, they're now blindly assuming every exchange is like FTX blowing away customer funds.

The swap functionality from BUSD to USDC requires banking hours. Every properly managed stablecoin has its reserves in the legacy system in tradfi instruments dependent on legacy rails which is only operational 9 to 5 on business days. Since Binance autoconverts to BUSD and still allows USDC withdrawals, redeeming BUSD back to cash and then minting USDC needs legacy rails. USDC withdrawals got restored as soon as banks opened.

It would be easier for Binance not to support competitor's stablecoin USDC at all. You can't withdraw BUSD on Coinbase. Nobody asks why. Coinbase is even trying to push people away from USDT to its own stablecoin USDC. At least so far in the stablecoin wars, Binance has been the least anti-competitive out of the 3 major stablecoins.

The CNBC hosts then brought up something Kevin O'Leary said in congress. Kevin O'Leary lied that FTX buying out Binance's stake in the company 2 years ago is what made FTX become insolvent and said he wants a Madoff clawback. This clown is basically saying FTX was insolvent for 2 years and he invested and took money to promote an already insolvent company.

First of all, why the fuck was the official paid spokesperson for SBF allowed to testify? There's a clear conflict of interest. Binance invested in FTX back in 2019 and cashed out 2 years ago which it had every right to do. How is it relevant to FTX collapse?

FTX raised billions in several funding rounds since then, invested in big banner promotions and siphoned off customer funds to personal accounts. Binance was also paid mostly in FTX air tokens and was holding it all without selling until Alameda insolvency was exposed by Coindesk. After learning about Alameda insolvency, Binance announced it would liquidate those tokens over a period of few months but FTX collapsed the next day. Binance is still holding those FTT tokens and got rekt like everyone else.

When the CNBC hosts asked about this Madoff clawback Kevin O'Leary asked for, CZ said Binance's lawyers will deal with something like that. Some trolls on twitter edited the interview clip to look like CZ gave this response relating to users withdrawals.

Btw how about Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Shaq, Larry David, Biden, Warren, Maxine, all the celebrities, politicians and big shot funds return every single dollar as well? I'm all for it! For some reason, Kevin O'Leary specifically wants Binance to return a payment from 2 years ago rightfully owed to Binance by FTX.

Kevin O'Leary also lied in congress that CZ's tweet bankrupted FTX. According to Bahamian court records, it was ex co-CEO of FTX Ryan Salame who [blew the whistle](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/33/188450/042120682086.pdf) on FTX fraud and Alameda insolvency long before Coindesk expose article and CZ's tweet.

There's literally verifiable records of where it all went. It went to Alameda, SBF's personal accounts, to his parents, various properties, political donations and the rest of it was just massively overmarked FTT, SRM illiquid air tokens on Alameda's balance sheet. But Kevin still decides to defend SBF and blame Binance for FTX collapse while sticking up for all this fraud.

What dirt does SBF have on Kevin O'Leary that Kevin does not want people to know to keep defending a guy who clearly stole all customers' money? He's blaming a tweet for bankrupting a company which was already exposed to be insolvent. How can a tweet bankrupt a company? If ex co-CEO Ryan Salame had not blown the whistle, FTX would have sold billions more worth of paper bitcoin and stole all that money. SBF pledged to donate $1 billion to Biden's 2024 campaign. Where do you think that was going to come from?

Kudos to Joe Kernan for [calling out](https://nitter.it/GRDecter/status/1600858962555179010) this disgraceful piece of shit for lying and playing victim. Kevin O'Leary should be investigated as to why he keeps defending SBF saying that he did nothing wrong, what due diligence he did on FTX before becoming an official spokesperson and what knowledge he had as an official spokesperson about what was going on at FTX?

Another question the CNBC hosts asked was regarding big four audits for crypto firms. Enron was a big four audited public company (it was big five at the time). All the 2008 frauds had big four audits. Celsius had a $750 million funding round in December 2021 in which the lead investor brought in big four auditor Deloitte to do ""IPO level diligence"". [Here](https://nitter.it/jdorman81/status/1603538603824422912) is a CFA talking about legacy auditors still learning how to properly audit crypto firms.

[Big four audit firms keep failing. Now they’re being forced to change](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/06/business/uk-big-4-accountancy-firms-frc/index.html)

[The Wirecard Scandal - Hundreds of Wirecard employees lost their jobs, investors lost a total of €4.5 billion. Why didn't big four auditors recognize the fraud?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_0XEIFGK5o)

[KPMG – How a Big Four auditing firm went rogue in its greed for profit](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-09-16-kpmg-how-a-big-four-auditing-firm-went-rogue-in-its-greed-for-profit/)

I think it would be more reliable than any big four audit to have a rigorous proof of reserves standard established that anyone can easily verify everything on chain. It would take a lot of work to establish a uniform industry standard but that is definitely the way forward. Legacy audits are obsolete for bitcoin and big four is just a grift. Bitcoin is self auditable by anyone and so should be all businesses involved in bitcoin.

Binance has over $60 billion in identified cold wallets and $13 billion flows were processed in a single day during an irrational FUD storm without a hitch. There are many reasons to criticize Binance. I have criticisms myself and shared one of them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y74xc8/ama_binancecom_product_team_here_ask_us_anything/isu7suz/), but the fact is no other exchange could handle these flows.

Exchanges should never be used for holding coins. Learn to self custody and better yet, learn to use P2P exchanges like Bisq, Robosats and HodlHodl. It's a small learning curve but once you learn you'll never need centralized exchanges anymore.

But Binance is not FTX. With FTX, there were not even identifiable cold wallets. FTX was outspending Binance, a much larger exchange on lavish marketing and partnerships, sold billions worth of paper bitcoin. Alameda was liquidating even sub $1 million positions on yield farms to backstop bitcoin withdrawals because it had zero reserves. Binance has shit to be called out on like every exchange but liquidity is not one of them.

ETH is slowly becoming decentralised in name only,13,znebgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znebgn/eth_is_slowly_becoming_decentralised_in_name_only/,299,1671196177.0,"How can a cryptocurrency, an invention that has been introduced to remove our financial sovereignty away from the nepotistic fiat gatekeepers which currently control our institutions, be owned by the very same gate keepers and still claim to be fair and transparent? It’s quite bizarre and contradictory from a simplistic, first principle basis.

The entire purpose of cryptocurrencies very existence is to get away from centralised financial institutions and remove the elements of human control. Level the playing field where everyone, regardless of whoever you may be and wherever you are in the world, obeys by the same rules.

JP Morgan have a lot of control and influence in the financial/political spheres. They control fiat money printing. They now also own a stake, in a company that maintains the infrastructure of a cryptocurrency that has recently become POS, which therefore allows it to become more likely likely to be attacked from an outside force using staking governance (very easy to do if you literally lend, control and print fiat money as a company).

https://protos.com/consensys-lawsuit-jpmorgan-owns-critical-ethereum-infrastructure/

This is not just a little frivolous investment venture. JP Morgan literally owns a large chunk  ETH network and has all the leverage in the world to influence the direction of ETH policies/monetary issuance in the analog world. Throw enough money at it and I’m sure JP Morgan could even grow a movement to hard fork the entire chain. It’s a direct conflict of interest.

BTC doesn’t have this issue for obvious reasons. There is no CEO or central foundation that controls the policies. The nodes will still have the power over consensus. ETH is now in a situation where a bank can just simply buy its way in and influence the very rules of the network. It has become the very thing it was created to fight against. Quite ironic in a way.

Regarding consensys and JP Morgan, it’s quite interesting Joe Lubin is accused of being a fraud and 35 ex-employees (making up more than 50% of the shareholders) requested legal action against the company.

https://tokenist.com/consensys-founder-accused-of-39m-fraud-involving-jpmorgan/

It’s quite obvious (to me at least) that ETH is slowly becoming decentralised in name only. There should be outrage from within the ETH community but as far as I can see it’s business as usual.

I believe we’ll see the real shit show unfold when it comes to the unstaking period (which will be pushed back indefinitely).",2022-12-16 15:09:37

I wanted to provide some facts because the post was full of FUD. 

First some information on Bitvavo. Bitvavo is the largest Dutch exchange. It’s liked because of their fair fees and smooth interface. They are also big players in the Belgium and German market. Ranked 45th in comparison to all exchanges. 
Bitvavo offers staking services but don’t do that in-house. Therefor, 16% of customer assets are locked in Gemini. This wasn’t really bad management or wrongdoing. It was offering services every exchange was offering. 

FUD:
1. Bitvavo is insolvent.
FALSE.  Withdrawal operate just fine. 

2. Bitvavo are insolvent because I couldn’t withdrawal on the app.
FALSE. There was on withdrawal option on the app to begin with. You had to withdrawal on the website.

3. Bitvavo wrongfully advertises with a 100k insurance backed by the Dutch Central Bank. 
FALSE. Although they have a license from the Dutch Central Bank, Bitvavo only offers insurance against theft. They don’t specify if this particular situation falls under the insurance BUT my best guess is not. 

Look, I have no money on Bitvavo. They could still become insolvent, so I would recommend withdrawing. But, stop with FUD and fear mongering for cheap karma.

It is important to acknowledge that the FTX saga is not unlike the Mt Gox Saga and the culprit is the boss of both exchanges engaging in malicious book-keeping & accounting.,9,znaz0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/znaz0e/it_is_important_to_acknowledge_that_the_ftx_saga/,15,1671184011.0,"#This thread is for the occasional non-coiner browsing reddit and wanting to understand what this all is. So if this sounds like common sense for those of you who have been around for a few years, pardon me for sounding like captain obvious.               

Yes I know we can't really compare Mt Gox to FTX, but the thing is you could say one took place at a larger scale than the other. Secondly, Mt Gox's CEO discovered a hardware wallet he had that contained 200k BTC on it, and with price appreciation over time, seems to (at least hypothetically) re-imburse creditors with a cash equivalent of what they put into his exchange.                 

Imagine you start a hedge-fund that is growing very quickly on wall street and no matter how much money you invest in that hedge fund, they won't give you a seat on the board of directors, and they don't do proper accounting. Even worse, instead of producing proper accounting documentation, they produce zero accounting documentation. Now if it sounds strange to the tradfi bros out there, it's probably because companies on wall street are properly audited regularly (or so I imagine since madoff's arrest they were?). FTX's main office was situated in the Bahamas, and therefore exempt from enforcement while FTX US was not, but there is still a massive question mark over everyone's head as to who, if anyone, will have funds returned to them.               

TL;DR - FTX was more trad-fi malicious accounting and less ""blockchain scams"".              

EDIT: Does this mean the exchanges should come together and start auditing each other? Proof of reserves does not mean proof of solvency, as it doesn't present the amount of money the exchange owes their users.",2022-12-16 11:46:51

The company's new leadership asked a federal bankruptcy judge for permission to sell off parts of the failed crypto empire’s business early next year — while those subsidiaries of FTX are still valuable.

Lawyers representing FTX filed a motion to begin an auction process for digital currency derivatives platform LedgerX, stock trading service Embed, as well as FTX Japan and FTX Europe.

“The longer operations are suspended, the greater the risk to the value of the assets and the risk of a permanent revocation of licenses,” lawyers from law firm Sullivan and Cromwell argued on behalf of the company in a motion filed Thursday evening.

LedgerX, which FTX acquired last year, was believed to be one of the few parts of the corporate family that remained liquid as parent company FTX and its closely linked investment fund Alameda Research hemorrhaged money. Lawyers for the company argue that the other affiliates they want to sell off could continue to lose staff and their good standing with regulators the longer they remain tied to the parent company, even though their business operations are separate and the subsidiaries are believed to be solvent.

FTX’s Bahamian operations, which Sam Bankman-Fried personally oversaw, and Alameda Research were the epicenters for alleged malfeasance, for which co-founder and majority owner Bankman-Fried was arrested and indicted on multiple charges of fraud earlier this week.

“It is a priority of [FTX] to explore sales, recapitalizations or other strategic transactions with respect to such subsidiaries and assets,” the motion said.

Proposed dates for the bidding and sale approval process vary by subsidiary, but preliminary bids are due from mid-January to early February. Final bids are due mid-February to mid-March, and auction dates run from late February to late March. After those auctions, the presiding judge, John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, will hold hearings to approve winning bids.

Objections to the sale proposal are due Dec. 29, and a hearing on the topic is scheduled for Jan. 11.

If only one qualified bid is made on a business before the final bid deadline, FTX’s leadership proposes cancelling the auction and seeking approval for that bid.

A full list of dates follows. All dates are in 2023. 

Preliminary bid deadlines:

    Embed, Jan. 18

Thoughts and Questions on the Next Bitcoin Halving,3,zn3g1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zn3g1w/thoughts_and_questions_on_the_next_bitcoin_halving/,31,1671156979.0,"As it stands right now the next Bitcoin halving is scheduled to be around March 2024. Will it really create the price increase that many are forecasting and it historically has?

The rewards sizes will drop from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. Everyone knows that there will only ever be 21 million BTC and the current supply is approximately 19.23 million BTC. Who knows how many have been burned in one way or another via lost wallets and what not.

My understanding is that each BTC halving is supposed to create more scarcity by lowering the block rewards but shouldn't there become a point where the halving is so small that it won't have the expected affect that it historically has?

My reason for asking is that it feels like shooting fish in a barrel to go long crypto right now based on how far it's fallen from the recent ATH, whether that be buying long OTM calls on crypto stocks or going long on coins. Almost like it would be too easy to make money that way. Since its seems like it would be so easy I feel like I should inverse actually myself and short everything crypto related based on the idea that the halving won't have the impact that is anticipated.

Am I crazy to think that the halving won't do what we expect or will it always have the expected bump in crypto markets? Very interested to get some informed opinions on this.",2022-12-16 04:16:19

Earlier in the week Charles made a prediction that Ripple case would end today or settle. Actually I think he said they would lose, I can’t remember the entirety of it, nevertheless it opened my eyes.

It’s easy in this space and market to listen to what the “experts” say and time and time again they are wrong. Obviously the case was not settled today so makes you wonder why the claim in the first place? He also claimed he had inside information to know this. It’s no different than Saylor bashing ETH, he doesn’t know and it doesn’t matter what he thinks.

So moral of my babbling is that I truly know now that nobody knows anything and your guess is as good as theirs as to where things are heading. So just sit tight and let it all play out how it will.

And I get it, during the bull everything was great and it’s hard to stay away and not be a shill when things are going up.

But this bear has been haunted by so many drastic events (Luna, FTX, war, inflation, etc).  So it’s natural there is constant article spam of recent events.  In previous bear cycles, not only does content dry up, but what is left is usually actual talk about projects and development.

It is rare to find actual discussion on projects over the past year to see what has potential for the future, or what real world problems or use cases are being solved.

As refreshing as it is that SBF has finally been apprehended, I truly hope we can get back to focusing on the projects in this industry sooner rather than later.  Another 6 months to a year of the same FTX fallout does not bring any real news to this space.

Progressivism and Bitcoina are not opposed-Margot Paez,0,zmzy8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmzy8f/progressivism_and_bitcoina_are_not_opposedmargot/,7,1671147111.0,"It’s time to set the record straight. Too many who write or pontificate about Bitcoin do not know what progressivism means in the political realm of American politics — [looking at you Daniel Kuhn](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2021/12/14/bitcoin-is-free-and-fair-but-not-progressive/). In reality, many ideas among progressives and the left, are wholly aligned with Bitcoin’s mission.

“Progressive” is really an umbrella term that lumps together many left-leaning political ideologies under a set of demands that we *deem* to be inalienable rights of any human. These are education, healthcare, a living wage and housing. It is true that progressives do put demands on the government to protect and nurture these allegedly inalienable rights. However, you shouldn’t believe that progressives and the left are defenders of the state simply because they demand better of it.

In practice, progressives do their best work when they are not focused on electoral politics. At the local level, progressives focus on mutual aid, trade unions and grassroots organizing. These stem from the revolutionary anarchist tradition which came about due to horrific working conditions during the early centuries of capitalism.

The 19th century revolutionary anarchist’s goal was the absolute dissolution of the state by any means necessary. Anarchists despised the state with a passion that went beyond anything Murray Rothbard could have expressed. Anarchists of the time engaged in guerrilla warfare and many died trying to destroy the state (Rothbard lived out his life comfortably under the state, I might add). Progressives may not be trying to blow up the state these days, but they put major emphasis on providing for communities without help from the government.

Many assume that since Bitcoin inherently protects the right to property and individual ownership that it must be ideologically opposed to the beliefs of progressives. Actually, progressives aren’t opposed to owning things, in general. What it boils down to is rent, interest and democratic enterprises. What progressives really want are rent-free economies.

In fact, if you go back to the 19th century classical economic discussions of a free market, that’s what people like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, David Ricardo and others were trying to figure out. So, owning bitcoin is not in opposition to progressivism. Progressives are not inherently opposed to money, just opposed to how it is used as a means of control and power. Progressives and Bitcoiners are in opposition to neoliberalism because, among other problems that it created, neoliberalism is upheld through state violence.

As for exclusive individual ownership in Bitcoin, that is just a misunderstanding of Bitcoin. Bitcoiners are very proud of El Zonte, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach experiment. It’s hailed as a model for a successful circular economy based on Bitcoin. Here, the developers of the Bitcoin Beach wallet realized that locals would benefit from a community-based custodial option. In this case, the wallet makes it possible to designate a trusted member of the community to be the holder of the private keys for other people’s wallets. Here, responsibility is now coupled with community-based trust, not individual responsibility.

The idea of individual responsibility is one that is unique to the West and more so to the United States. Community identity is much more important in other parts of the world. Since Bitcoin has done so well in many developing nations where community is more valuable than individuality, it is hard to believe that Bitcoin is truly only for those concerned with strict individualism.

Another interesting community-owned idea in Bitcoin is the federated mint ([FediMint](https://fedimint.org/)). Here, a community with a certain amount of trust among its members, can effectively co-own the mint. This leads to a whole set of new ideas about community-based currencies that are backed by Bitcoin, that remind me a bit of Paul Grignon’s ideas about self-issued credit but also of Prodhoun’s concept of a People’s Bank, both coupled with John Nash’s work on ideal money. There is so much here that appeals to the progressive!

The only real part about Bitcoin that seems ideologically opposed to progressives at the moment is the 21 million bitcoin cap. The main reason is that there are economic leaders in the movement who are followers of John Maynard Keynes. This stems likely from the Keynesian critique of neoclassical economics and the argument that markets do not tend toward full employment, among other things.

Some of the desire for post-Keynesian approaches may be nostalgia for that long-dead constrained era of capitalism during the post-WWII period. Some of it is a seemingly pragmatic approach to softening boom-bust cycles, in which Keynes argued that deficit spending should occur during economic crises and be constrained during surpluses. Hyman Minsky, another pillar of economics for progressives, attempted to unite Joseph Schumpeter (Austrian school) and Keynes to understand how to stabilize an unstable economy. By the way, this [unification](https://www.amazon.com/Barnes-Noble-Routledge-Classics-set/dp/1138641952%5C) (written in the early 1980s) provided a prophetic prediction of the Great Recession.

Even though there seems to be contradiction here between Keynesian ideas and Bitcoin’s monetary policy, some of the most progressively-aligned economists, like Michael Hudson and Steve Keen, regularly appear on Max Keiser’s “Keiser Report” for their sharp critiques of the banking system, dollar hegemony, quantitative easing, and neoclassical economics. Are you surprised? Progressive economists get it, they just aren’t convinced that the existing system can operate under a capped monetary policy. This is the problem in understanding, really. What Bitcoiners are really advocating for is a new system altogether.

Today, [modern monetary theory](https://www.investopedia.com/modern-monetary-theory-mmt-4588060) (MMT) has taken hold of the progressive movement because it also centers the idea of a full employment guarantee where the government backstops the private sector employment with non-competitive jobs. MMT advocates also believe that they can control the money supply and inflation through fiscal and monetary policy. They argue that by bringing full productive forces online (no more, no less) that inflation can be properly managed. However, it has never been tried; the Federal Reserve Board does not practice real MMT at this time. To be clear, even MMT advocates are critical of quantitative easing.

This is not to say that the left gives a full-throated endorsement of MMT, either. There are plenty of critiques of MMT from the left, all one has to do is look for them. Even so, Bitcoin is still appealing to a progressive even if they are MMT supporters simply because of the concerns over the goodness of their money over time. All one really needs to do is explain to the progressive how inflation decoupled from adjustments in living wage is a silent killer of their paycheck. What’s the alternative? Save some of that purchasing power over the long term by “hodling” bitcoin, of course.

Progressives are well aware of the damage the Federal Reserve and the government did during the Great Recession. Progressives supported Occupy Wall Street because many of them lost their homes to illegal foreclosures. Progressives need to be reminded, though, that the ivory towers of central banks are not any more our friends than the mega-corporation banks are. We can do better to educate our fellow progressives on money as a technology and on the idea that we can have a different economic system where a 21 million cap works.

To stimulate this idea of a different economic system, let’s pull from the degrowth movement. Degrowth encompasses a lot of ideas, but the main one is that our economic system should be tied to our planet’s ability to sustain life. Given the ease at which the banking system generates money (has anyone else compared the S&P 500 chart to the climate change hockey stick chart?), and the obvious trends that as our Gross Domestic Product has gone up, so have our carbon emissions, it seems entirely logical that we should have a cap somewhere.

In the degrowth literature, there have been discussions about tying a currency to the amount of energy produced. Bitcoin’s network is backed by access to energy resources. Its mining protocol scales based on the price of electricity. It also has the ability to bring online wasted and stranded energy. This means that the network grows with a speed limit. We can plan whole economies around this prospect.

Furthermore, Bitcoin disintermediates the banking system and puts banking not only in the hands of the individual but of communities (something that Occupy Wall Street advocated for). Communities and/or cooperatives (like in the [autonomous people’s economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria) in Rojava) can issue their own community-backed loans using bitcoin as the backing. There’s much to be explored here and progressives (and leftists more broadly) can really lead the way.

The reality is not that Bitcoin needs to be rebranded to fit a progressive narrative. It is that Bitcoiners – and non-Bitcoiners alike – need to realize that while the network’s genesis block was a political attack on the central banking system, that this sentiment is not exclusive to American libertarianism. This is why progressives are in the Bitcoin space, because we know that Bitcoin is for everyone, and we’re going to make sure that everyone, not just Libertarians, know that there is a way to exit the system and that Bitcoin can help us find the way out.

"Sadly, I do believe a lot of you are missing the angle as to why Binance will now inevitably fail... please let me explain:",0,zmviss,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmviss/sadly_i_do_believe_a_lot_of_you_are_missing_the/,193,1671136982.0,"A lot of you have been saying things like: Changpeng Zhao is such a great guy. No way, Binance is too big to fail, if it does, all cryptocurrency would be worthless. Binance is the best exchange, and it has survived so many crypto winters, and the list goes on and on.

Now, all of these things are fine and good, but the angle that many of you seem to be missing is that he totally fuck over a lot of really really powerful people, people who have the ability to take CZ's toy away from him, and completely break it into a million fucking pieces, and there isn't a damn thing he will be able to do about it.

Because of his little public stunt with Sam Bankman-Fried, on Twitter, for all to see, he has now painted himself as a danger to so many big financial and government entities. These entities, and the people who make them up do not like to see this kind of power in the hands of a nobody. They play by these rules, they make the calls as to who stays and who goes... and now CZ has stepped on all their dicks.

With all this being said, I think many of you are starting to see the writing on the wall. It doesn't matter how good a ship CZ runs over there at his company Binance, or how good they are at (insert whatever cryptocurrency positive here), you don't piss off the United States of America and its governing body.

They have already made a circus with the FTX hearing, and they are all out for blood. Not to mention all of the bad people in the world who lost money in the FTX downfall, these people are now going after CZ too, and it isn't going to end well for Binance... or Changpeng Zhao.

What CZ should have done is went through backroom channels in order to leak the same information he did to garner the same effect, or just wait a few months, and FTX would have imploded on its own, and CZ would have had no connection to its downfall whatsoever... but no... he had to go the petty route, and for some 5 minute Twitter fame, and do this all publicly... and now he totally fucked himself, and the reign of his beloved Binance.

The recent bank runs were only the beginning. The United States is the master of lies, deception, and false information, otherwise known as ""fake news"". They are going to use all of their power and focus, and their state run media to tell the truth, and fabricate negative stories on Binance until the end of time. They are going to use their governing bodies to create insane regulation that Binance could and will never be able to abide by.

I can go on and on, but I think you get the point. Changpeng Zhao done fucked up by kicking the hornets nest known as FTX, and in the process... has awoken the sleeping giant known as the United States of America.",2022-12-15 22:43:02

Hi there,

I probably have a very basic question but I'm only now getting into ledgers and self custody, thanks CZ :)

I now have my BTC in a mobile wallet as an in between solution. I don't really like the fact that I have it wired to the internet all day and i watch alot of porn so who knows what sites are using what data there.

So I want a ledger, I'm getting it when my next paycheck comes in. 

So my question: can I use my 24 word seedphrase (bip-39 or 36 or whatever) to import my mobile wallet into a ledger using ledger live? I couldn't find a conclusive answer online so maybe one of you guys can help.

Thanks in advance",2022-12-15 21:40:18

According to shrimp-surveying platform Shrimp Alert, the wealthy investor abruptly transferred a staggering 9x10E-8 thousand ETH worth just over $0.00000012 million from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet.

The sending wallet was emptied of all ETH and only held on to the tokens for just a few hours, according to blockchain search engine [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x72537173157981079c7766ac924202faa63aa065defb7b1fe856470a99bf579f).

Data from leading analytics platform IntoTheBlock finds that 20% of ETH’s supply is currently being held by crypto shrimps or plancton. It also finds that 37% of the SOL rival’s holders are in profit while 64% of them are underwater while 41% of SOL holders are in the green while about 17% of them are seeing red.

According to blockchain tracking service [ShrimpStats](https://www.whalestats.com/analysis-of-the-top-100-eth-wallets), ETH is the top holding among the world’s poorest 1,000 Bitcoin shrimp.

ShrimpStats’ on-chain data reveals that the top 1,000 BTC shrimp hold a combined $0.1 million worth of ETH. Their next highest holding is oracle providing blockchain Chainlink (LINK) at $0.09 million, followed far after by Odlavso's buttcoin (BUTTS) at $0.001 million.

At time of writing, ETH is changing hands at $1,321, up about 7% from its week’s low of $1,238.

It's not exclusive to crypto.

I get banking scams all the time, trying to get my bank logins.To the point where you have to assume everything is a scam, until proven otherwise.

People lost millions in their bank funds last year through the Zelle app. So even trusted banks and apps, can get you scammed. Even when you get a shipping notification from Amazon, it can sometimes be a scam..

In crypto, scams take many shapes, but they have common dead giveaways. Here are just a few of them.

&#x200B;

# A few of the common red flags:

One of the following on its own may not mean it's a scam, but when you add up too many of the following red flags, you may have a scam.

&#x200B;

**1- Marketing focuses on returns not tech/utility.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1810fw9k36a1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca95cdc5092993f5b4bac47c6f3dd5cd8d4a872

&#x200B;

**2- Marketing focuses on celebrity endorsement and influencers.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s01mwrn3l36a1.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b447fd7dd5a8b446652f2666d5e414396210f9f4

&#x200B;

**3- It's in the name.**

Scams will often give themselves away in their names.

If it has words that takes advantage of a the latest fad or popular name like Shib, Inu, Elon, are about gains  (rocket,  moon, tendies, etc), or tells you it's safe, has a tacky name or something that looks more like marketing than serious, or tries to trick people by looking similar as something popular, it might be a red flag.

What better name to confuse people than ""Bitcoiin"". It's not a typo, it's the new Bitcoin!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**4- Things don't add up.**

They are spending more on marketing than tech.

They are spending too much money, like buying stadiums.

They are brand new and have a massive market cap.

The tokenomics don't add up.

There's these strange inexplicable whale wallets that aren't for liquidity pool etc...

It's too centralized.

It's not transparent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wkl1svtdm36a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=856731d6b50d501a2e5644baafaada4e32376bf4

&#x200B;

**5- The mechanism of the token isn't solution oriented,  nor is rewarding those who provide security or a service, but it seems to financial favor a group who is passively earning without offering a valuable service in return.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5iqbea85m36a1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e2436c87525cc07bc47ec15562c5f6121866242

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7- You get unbelievably big yields, big rewards, big returns. It looks like easy money.**

There is no such thing as easy money or a free meal. Everything has a cost.

If something is too good to be true, it probably is.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h6ya8k0tm36a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b2bbeed5762b60943284c2a4c68b65654a7002e

&#x200B;

**8- Something doesn't sound right about their team.**

Founders that do not have much experience in the field.

They've only been in failed or scammy projects before.

The founders are on Instagram bragging about the money they make.

The team is misleading or doesn't even exist.

# 

**9- Too good to be true giveaways. No, nobody is gonna give you any significant amount of crypto for no reason.**

&#x200B;

**10- Red flag with white paper.**

It doesn't explain the tech, sounds more like a sales pitch, has spelling errors, doesn't look serious, is too vague, doesn't address key tech functions or tokenomics, or is non existent. Or has a combination of red flags.

They are a way for members to be rewarded for their contributions in r/CryptoCurrency with a subreddit unit of ownership. Moons are unrelated to Reddit, and once earned, neither admins nor subreddit moderators may take them away from users. A set of smart contracts handles balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and acquiring Special Memberships. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/))

**The Question: Will Moons ever moon again and how many moons (months, pun intended) will it take?**

* According to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon), the last ATH of Moons was on September 06, 2021 (over a year ago) with a dollar equivalent of  $1.56 but according to [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/). the previous ATH was supposed to be  $0.435 on a different date which was Aug 04, 2021. According to some past sources here, coingecko's data on Moons ATH was somewhat skewed and attributed it as a ""glitch in the matrix"" so for accuracy purposes let's assume coinmarketcap's ATH as the basis for this question. 

Assuming that Bitcoin's next halving will be around the same time another bull run will emerge, how likely do you think Moons will peak again? Will it go beyond the previous ATH? With this given scenario the next bull run would likely happen in around **480** days ([based](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/halving/) on the next halving), that should be enough time for most r/cc shrimps and fishes to accumulate. There are externals factors though that might affect/prevent this from happening such as the more mainstream introduction of crypto, the current issues facing crypto-related platforms, and the never-ending queries and probing of government institutions regarding crypto.

What are you thoughts? Do you think Moons will ever conquer it's previous peak?",2022-12-15 19:36:01

On Wednesday, December 14, Web3 ecosystem developer and blockchain engineering firm ConsenSys announced that they have joined hands with PayPal in a new way for users to purchase crypto in MetaMask.

This PayPal integration into MetaMask will provide a simple and convenient way for users to purchase crypto. For now, this facility is available only to select MetaMask users in the U.S. and shall roll out to all customers in the coming weeks.

This also makes MetaMask the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal and drive successful on-ramp transactions. Note that with the PayPal integration, MetaMask is currently allowing the purchase of only Ethereum (ETH).

MetaMask is a leading self-custody wallet quite popular among crypto users. It also allows millions of crypto enthusiasts to interact with other applications such as play and earn, NFT marketplaces, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

The crypto wallet service provider is now looking to expand and diversify the payment options via the MetaMask mobile app. Speaking on the development, Lorenzo Santos, Product Manager for MetaMask, added:

“This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem.”

Recently, MestaMask users expressed their displeasure over ConsenSys’ privacy policy. This happened after ConsenSys confirmed that they collect user data on their on-chain wallet service.

ConsenSys Launches zkEVM
A day before, ConsenSys unveiled its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) network for private beta testing. This would allow developers to deploy and manage their decentralized applications directly using tools like MetaMask, Truffle and Infura.

This development will also help in bridging assets between zkEVM and the Goerli testnet for developers to test their smart contracts and DApps. Speaking on the development, ConsenSys said:

“Testnet participants can also bridge tokens, transfer tokens, and interact with deployed dApps listed on our upcoming ecosystem portal page. We intend to learn whether the developer experience of the zkEVM has the potential to accelerate innovation in Web3 and will be evaluating feedback from the community to inform our next step.”",2022-12-15 19:37:30

first off - Yes, I hold ATOM

&#x200B;

# Why should you even bother looking into the Cosmos ecosystem?

**Interchain security**

so a quick explanation of what the Cosmos ecosystem is.

when you hear about Cosmos most of you will think ATOM, but ATOM is just one blockchain in the COSMOS. see picture below but basically any coin in Cosmos is it's own independent blockchain connected to each other by IBC (Inter-blockchain communication protocol). IBC allows for cross-chain communication between all these independent blockchains.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgf9brteg36a1.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1a3ee1f75ed3747ff3fc2de5792313c4b413bb8

The cosmos hub (ATOM) is at the center

https://preview.redd.it/rei6pj42g36a1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f86abdc9d669dbc39bb319ad000e56adc680a58

 Cosmos also has two tools that make creating a blockchain faster and easier, (Tendermint & Cosmos SDK) but even with both of these tools the biggest issue that new chains face is having to get their own validators (it's expensive).

so this is what Interchange Security is trying to solve and probably the most bullish case for ATOM. New chains will be able to rent Cosmos Hub (ATOM) validators for app-chain network security at a price.

Currently if you are staking ATOM you get ATOM staking rewards, same as any other blockchain.

when Interchain security is implemented and you stake ATOM you will not only get ATOM staking rewards but you will also receive native tokens of any chain using Interchain security. If for example five new chains started in the cosmos ecosystem and chose to use Interchain security, you would now receive not only your ATOM staking rewards but would also receive staking rewards from blockchain 1, 2 ,3, 4 & 5  for the same amount of ATOM you were already staking before.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

You will receive staking reward from any chain using interchain security after it is implemented by simply staking ATOM.",2022-12-15 19:19:50

""What comes next some of my colleagues have suggested somehow pausing cryptocurrency before we pass legislation. This is a profoundly misguided not  to mention impossible idea short of enacting  draconian authoritarian policies cryptocurrency cannot be stopped. If we try the technology would  simply migrate offshore. Cryptocurrency does not need brick and mortar facilities to operate, and typing computer code should clearly be seen  as a form of protected speech. Are we going to  decide to pause the constitution in order to stop  crypto. This is exactly the kind of mindset that has driven this activity to the darker and less regulated parts of the world. Now if Congress had  passed legislation to create a well-defined regulatory regime with sensible guard rails. We'd have multiple U.S exchanges competing here  under the full force of those laws and regulations. I**n that scenario it's not clear that FTX would have ever existed** at least on the scale that it did. Not if we had American companies that  were an alternative and properly regulated. 

""The complete indifference to an appropriate regulatory regime by both Congress and the SEC  probably contributed to the rise of operations  like FTX. Others have suggested that we refrain  from addressing cryptocurrency at all because we wouldn't want to legitimize its use well I  think that is both misguided and irresponsible  Congress can and should offer a sensible approach for the domestic regulation of these activities.""

&#x200B;

The big take away is he even admits if the USA gov got their heads out of their own ass and actually did their damn job instead of being super corrupt. **FTX WOULD LIKELY NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY DID.**

And the other things is, you can't shut down crypto. Code is protected under freedom of speech. So while in the USA we might not openly admit we have crypto. We also would be able to work on it, and it is all online.

&#x200B;

# BIG THING TO NOTE

This is the first time in human history outside of religion, you have a fully decentralized thing the gov can't exactly shut down. Not at this scale at least.

So like back in the day when gov would try to kill and go after religious people. If you miss some, it doesn't stop it. And if too many areas had followers. In the areas where the gov went nuts, the people would move. Or more likely, they would just bring it underground. Look at the fish symbol. That was made as a code symbol so followers would recognize one another. Keep in mind the roads they had back then and most areas was covered with dirt.

In some places like China they used Magic Mirrors. This is basically a mirror that looks normal when you look at it up front. But when you reflect light off of it. An image will show in the reflection. Again, they used this to help identify each other.

While not a religion, when Freemasons were sent to the camps in WWII. They would use forget-me-not flower for the same reasons above.

&#x200B;

    Rant start:

Lets say the USA went nuts and made crypto illegal. Would that cause most of us to dump our crypto? No. Personally I'm fucked without it. Like thanks due to piss poor management of our economy, job market, extreme discrimination against disabled people, and so on. This is it. And I imagine for many others it might be the same or close to it. Like if it doesn't work, there is no retirement. There is no happy happy life. My generation has lived through 1 economic or other crises after another. I made a post a while back showing how screwed we truly are. Since mid or late 90s to now we had OVER 40 crises in the USA alone. Prior there was 40 in maybe 100 or so years (I can't remember exactly, but we gotten like a hundred years worth of crap that happened in my generation). Like some might be able to make it without, and I'm happy for them. But there is some really nasty stories out there and it doesn't look like the older generations in power give a fuck about us. In fact, it seems like they want to keep making it worse.

So many of us will view it as we have nothing to lose. Throw us in jail and that's at least a free meal and place to stay. Take our life and we will say we were going to end up dead anyways one day. Make it too painful and we will end up ending it ourselves.

    Rant end: (sorry about that. It just pisses me off to that point to being that screwed for no fault of my own.)

So unlike something like drugs or whatever. It is impossible to shut it down.

Look at China. It is illegal there, and I can 100% tell you it still is in heavy use there and mining still happens there. Maybe not to the degree it was. But it didn't die.

The only way to end it is the same way to end religion. You have to wipe out people. And if it is too large, outside of wiping out everyone on Earth. It is impossible. The more the gov fight it and attack it, the more people will turn to it.",2022-12-15 19:15:35

Definitely nothing fishy going on here. Provided links to back up my statements, yet the downvotes are flowing in like this is a top post in controversial.**

Thanks to Bitcoin, [the largest commercial solar panel and battery farm in the world is being built in Texas after a partnership with Tesla and a bunch of Bitcoin mining companies like Blockstream and Block.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html)

The [Navajo nation now has a solar farm and battery storage facility providing hundreds of new jobs for them and growing, all thanks to their Bitcoin mining operations](https://youtu.be/b94XAejlFa8).

Bitcoin [mining thrives on cheap electricity, and there is no cheaper electricity than that which is provided by the sun for free, harnessed through solar panels and stored in batteries for later consumption until the sun rises again the next day to start the charge and usage cycle all over again.](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf).

I’m also an environmentalist, and that is the biggest reason I became a Bitcoin miner. It was the only feasible way to invest in green energy formation and storage technology and make it profitable enough to be able and continue to develop more

Thanks to Bitcoin, we might actually have enough solar, wind, and battery farms one day to rid ourselves of the dirty energy production companies.

The irony that so called environmentalist today bash Bitcoin, while it does more to create the infrastructure we needed to achieve 100% green energy production and storage one day than any other industry, is astounding

Reddit’s push into tokenized avatars has been a rare bright spot amid declining NFT sales and a wider crypto market in turmoil, and now the Polygon-based initiative has marked a new milestone with more than 5 million of the collectibles minted to date.

The Reddit Collectible Avatars NFT initiative crossed the 5 million mark over this week, according to blockchain data curated on a Dune dashboard. They’re not highly concentrated among high-value NFT collectors (or whales), either, as the project has more than 4.25 million total unique wallets. About 3.95 million of those wallets hold a single Reddit NFT.

Reddit’s NFT program is a great example of how Web2 platforms can spur potentially massive adoption of Web3 technology through giveaways.

This avatar drop is very clearly rigged, probably being given out to developers friends or the brother of the sister of the guy who use to date reddits current CEO. 

Apparently only Reddit insiders are getting the low mints a we normies are going to get the high mint ones that aren't worth anything.

Binance earlier this week temporarily paused withdrawals of the USD Coin stablecoin due to inadequate USDC reserves on the platform. Zhao said the issue was related to a New York bank it uses to swap Paxos-issued BUSD holdings into USDC not being open at the time.

""We have the assets to convert,"" Zhao said. ""There’s no margin, there’s no leverage, we just needed the banks to open. When banks are closed and you try to withdraw money it doesn’t work.""

Zhao said Binance owes money to no one, doesn't have venture capital investments and has no loans.

""We manage our cash very simply,"" the CEO said.

""Just because bitten by one snake doesn’t mean any other animal is the same,"" he said, referring to the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.

He defended the company's EARN program, saying the customer money there is used for other margin traders to borrow from and ""sometimes we do run out because the demand supply some time don’t match up but the money never leave the platform and we do margin controls.""

He also insisted that his industry is more transparent than most traditional businesses, and he wants to set the gold standard for reliability.

""In our industry we don’t depend that much on trust we depend very much on verification."" 

Pushed to answer whether Binance could afford to pay back $2.1 billion that it received from its exit from FTX last year, Zhao said, ""We’re financially strong. We’ll let the lawyers handle it.""",2022-12-15 17:07:28

The Cosmos and a Sovereign Governance Module. The complicated “how to” for decentralizing The Hub and other blockchains to become uncensorable.,6,zmmo9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmmo9i/the_cosmos_and_a_sovereign_governance_module_the/,13,1671115212.0,"**Governance module**: a sovereign blockchain, that relies on Cosmos ICS. Pays a set inflation with no airdrop of any kind, rather the inflation at genesis and onward, goes toward delegator and validator rewards via ICS. The purpose is to allow for greater, more Sophisticated data availability and execution of Governance on The Hub.

**Utility**:

* Governance chain token is used to pay to propose Governance Proposals (IBC’d to ATOM chain for this purpose)
* Used to pay for slashing proposals  (mainnet Governance chain)
* Acts as a co-chain that executes the Governance for the ATOM chain, but as a sovereign entity. Sort of a data availability layer/Oracle of sorts, but for the ATOM chain specifically. And this sovereign chain can ececute Governance on the Hub using IBC functionality.
* Token is paid to ATOM stakers from staking via ICS.

**Why a Sovereign entity?**

In the grand scheme of blockchains, and stated by Nick White (Celestia) in his Cryptocito interview (YouTube) on Dec. 14th around 8 minutes into the interview. Nick mentioned that blockchains consists of three main functions:

1. Consensus
2. Data Availability
3. Execution

This premise in blockchain is important to know, because these issues all deal with the code itself, and each of these sections can add an additional level of complexity to the code. Which, thereby add an additional level of difficulty to the validating of the network. This makes a Validators jobs harder and makes the Validators less likely to accept a proposal that would increase validator difficulty and complexity, while also decreasing the relative power over all, for validators. This creates an issue, where Validators need to be incentivized to not only run the Governance module that’s limiting their power, but also be insured that they validate such a network in a trustless, honest manner as well.

**Example of restriction and some of its architecture**:

\-One of the restrictions that would be added to the Validators, if they chose to accept the Governance module, would be a code section that says they cannot hastily upgrade the Cosmos code, while the delegators backs are turned. This could be done through architecting a module on the sovereign governance chain, that executes the ability for the code to be uploaded, after a certain amount of time has been spent on a specific Testnet, 2 months (or 2 months worth of blocks for example). This could also act as a barrier to entry, for validators to upload code or upgrade the code.

How could this be set up?

It could start like this. In order to upload a prop, you must fill out the prop census, that allows you to explain the prop and upload the Prop to the chain. If a prop is accepted, a Testnet must be created and registered with the Governance chain, with a requirement that it’s labeled under the same number or “Prop ID” as the Prop number and must be IBC enabled to the Governance chain. This is done to establish and verify that the Testnet has officially begun, beginning the count down of the block requirement. (If this Testnet is not IBC enabled to the Governance module using the prop label, which is the number and details of the Prop, then the ability to upload that upgrade will be disabled until the Testnet is properly formed and being accounted for by the Governance prop).

(**Side note but relevant to the discussion**: In this model, we could also require certain lines of code to be added to the census. That way, the Governance module can recognize and deny any upgrade that would upload that line of code behind the backs of delegators. Effectively ensuring that the will of the delegators is being followed.)

This is only one example of how this governance chain could possibly interact and ensure the will of the delegators, while also providing value to the validators and delegators alike, with value derived from its utility as the de facto Governance token of the ATOM blockchain.

(**Sidenote**: this Testnet function, is relevant to my *second post* that I have included, which also adds in the emergency vote for validators to bypass the Testnet phase, with a vote from the delegators that renders the Testnet phase, effectively over and any emergency upgrades to be available for execution.)

**Adding the ability and right for delegators to slash certain validators when deemed necessary**:

Another check and balance here could be where the delegators can vote directly on the governance module to slash a Cosmos Hub validator if 67% come to agreement that a certain validator should be slashed for a particular reason. This could prove to be an important function of a governance network and could be automated to not rely on any party other than the delegators. For example: once the delegators vote passes with a “yes”, the governance module chain executes the slash. This (like the rest of these ideas) would be extremely complex IBC transactions that would need to happen, and with how much data and code complexity would be necessary, this may not be very plausible. But could be possible given the right technology advances in the IBC.

However, this delegator right to slash would be an interesting way for delegators to check the power of certain validators if deemed necessary. I have this as a high quorum item as well, due to the level of power this could give, we would need high level of agreement in a slashing scenario. Also, this would need a specific Governance process, as it is not a “regular” governance proposal. So I’m open to suggestions on how a delegators right to slash and a “Direct Delegator Slashing Process”, could work in practice, but I’ll keep thinking on how the structure could go.

**What gives this Governance token value?**

It’s main token utility is to be IBC’d over to the Hub, to use to pay for Governance proposals as well as used on its mainnet, to be used for other types of critical voting a proposal functions. It would act as a crucial piece of governance infrastructure for the Hub, and assuming the Hub gains value, it’s fair to assume that the Governance on the Hub and Governance chain and token, will gain in value as well.

**Is this automated Governance model better as a sovereign chain or should this be done on the Hub directly?**

This is at its roots, a two part question:

* Should the Hub stay as minimal as possible in its code base?
* Would the added complexity to the code, be acceptable for Validators to accept with no added incentive structure?

**Should the Hub stay as minimal as possible**

It is my opinion that the Hub ought to stay minimal in its code base. The Hub needs to be a consistent block producing machine, with as close to zero risk of failing as possible. The Hub is a relic and the genesis of the IBC. It should be reliable to be the safe haven of the Greater Cosmos as a whole, if chains go down, the ability to consolidate into the Hub for safety is the strong foundation the greater Cosmos ecosystem needs. So with that, while I personally believe that the current Cosmos Governance system needs some help. I do not believe that these automated governance structures, are viable to be executed on a chain like the Hub. Rather I believe that a sovereign chain, dedicated strictly to execution of Governance leveraging IBC functionality and ICS for security, is likely the best scenario.

I am well aware that the current iteration of IBC would be unable to execute such transactions and a lot more development and architecture is needed, but there’s a unique opportunity on the IBC, that no other chain has. Sovereign cross chain transactions could allow for better, more decentralized and censor resistant Governance.

**Would the added complexity to the code, be acceptable for Validators to accept with no added incentive structure?**

The next issue to tackle, and another reason I believe a Sovereign chain may be our best bet. The validators will need to accept the added complexity and that would be a challenge if we ask them to accept all of this complexity, with no incentive to do so. These transactions will likely be very complex and the code to do so, could take significant resources. So instead of asking them to accept it directly on the Hubs code, they could instead onboard a sovereign chain via ICS, that is coded specifically with the purpose of executing the Hubs automated Governance functionality. This chains token will have utility through being the token used to propose standard Governance on the Hub. It will also have voting structures or protocols on mainnet, that allow it to be used for automated governance on its mainnet as well, such as the voting for the delegators slashing of certain Hub validators.

**Conclusion**

While I acknowledge that this is a truly lofty goal and a large change to the Governance structure of the Cosmos as we know it, I believe we have a centralization problem that can’t be solved with more validators. More validators a can certainly help. But, automated Governance that is at the base code level, that allows for a high degree of checks and balances between delegators and validators is the solution in my eyes. The most decentralized part of the Hub is it’s delegation, why not find a way to use that as a tool to make the network unable to be censored.

New scam that everyone should know about,15,zmmh6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmmh6x/new_scam_that_everyone_should_know_about/,30,1671114715.0,"So a friend of mine sent me an image of a scam they just ran into. 

https://preview.redd.it/t5xfgz98i26a1.png?width=3384&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e253fda68faeefdced35b3684c728d661de729

I'm not exactly sure how they figured out it was a scam. It's an invoice scam where more than less a scammer using the invoice system on PayPal or other companies to scam you. 

From [https://www.discoveryit.com/blog/paypal-fake-invoice-scam/](https://www.discoveryit.com/blog/paypal-fake-invoice-scam/) (there is a video there that gets more into this scam)

>Anyone who knows your email address can send you a bill on your PayPal account. Fraudsters are taking on the fake PayPal invoice scam because they know that the invoices aren’t technically fake — they are real invoices from PayPal, only that the businesses don’t owe them.  
>  
>Scammers create invoices imitating reputable organizations such as antivirus companies, GoDaddy, or VPN services. Since the invoice will appear to come from one of your services, an unconscious accountant may be duped into believing the invoice is legitimate and make payment without questioning it.  
>  
>Since the PayPal invoice is real — only that scammers created it — hitting the Pay button will instantly transfer your money to the criminals.

Something to note is the seller note to customer IS from the seller. Like I know it seems obvious, but in researching this I guess some people for whatever reason thought it was from PayPal. 

&#x200B;

Note the link pushes it as it is just happening to business accounts. But this particular one it's slowly rolling out to average people 

[https://socialgrep.com/post/zk3qhq](https://socialgrep.com/post/zk3qhq)

[https://scammer.info/t/paypal-scam-903-270-5261-619-99/115970](https://scammer.info/t/paypal-scam-903-270-5261-619-99/115970)

&#x200B;

Anyways, to combat this you need to.

1. Look at your records to make sure the invoice is real. In this case it was a scammer marked their company as Bitcoin Crypto. To my guess, I think the scammer knew PayPal sold crypto and thought maybe people on PayPal were buying some.
2. Don't use links scammers give you, don't click buttons on the email. Go directly to PayPal and see if the invoice is even on there. A lot of times it will be, but it is a best practice to not click links on emails coming from banks or other things like that. 
3. Don't call the number they give you, but look it up. For those of you who doesn't know, you can do a """" on Google to search for exact match. Like ""(903) 270-5261"" will look for whatever with that exactly in it. Also look up the name of the company and other factors. 
4. Contact PayPal if you have questions about an invoice or if you find a fake invoice.

It is important to actually take the reporting to PayPal serious. This will prevent the scammer from dinging your account. 

If you did pay through PayPal. You can still report it and sometimes PayPal will help you get your money back. But take this seriously and do it ASAP.

How does a blockchain application get updated?,4,zmlikl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmlikl/how_does_a_blockchain_application_get_updated/,6,1671112186.0,"Hi everyone,   


As the title states, my questions revolve around how a blockchain application is updated/created etc.   


For example, 1inch exchange still requires that a website be managed, developed, etc. Who is doing this work and if these people stop, what happens to the network? My presumption is the whole network becomes redundant and the currency loses all value; but this implies that the application is very much a centralised system and runs just as any other business. 

Is my understanding flawed here? Are there examples where this wouldn't be the case?

Edit/update:
Thanks everyone for your responses.

Following from this, whilst anyone can make an interface to engage with the blockchain, a lot of the products out there on this space still rely on this interface to function and without that interface have no value. 

A growing example is cryptocurrencies in games; I’d argue this doesn’t hold to the premise of decentralisation and Are completely reliant on the development team. Saying that, do you think there will be a distinction through regulation between these systems and truly decentralised networks?",2022-12-15 15:49:46
DYOR framework: A guide on how to research and study a project before the next bull run,11,zmlerg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmlerg/dyor_framework_a_guide_on_how_to_research_and/,21,1671111891.0,"Finding a good project during a bear market is a great utilisation of your time, and helps you in overall understanding of the project you are investing in. 

I have tried to construct a framework for how to research any coin, and to see if it fits in your investment criteria. Some tokens might go to $0.  Others might break all-time highs in the next cycle. We have to evaluate possible bull market winners and losers. This is just a framework for the same.

&#x200B;

Here is the criteria we will be looking at:

1. Revenue
2. Treasury
3. Tokenomics
4. Locked up funds
5. Use case
6. Roadmap
7. Team funding

We can also add weightings to each category and provide an average score. It gives you more flexibility to weigh certain criteria more heavily than others.

Let’s go through step by step.  

**Step 1 –** Assign weightings to each criterion. Higher weighting = more important. Each person may want to assign different weightings depending on their own personal experience. E.g. after FTX collapse- you might weight ""Team"" as more important.

**Step 2-** Rank your project against each criterion out of 10 (Raw score). 1 being very poor and 10 being excellent in that category.

**Step 3-** Calculate your weighted average to give your project a score out of 10.

[You can make your own document, just like I did here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Da6duyw04PM1PrWuqy4mg6MJkQLDALc4rc1tbXJQnXg/edit?usp=sharing)

We are going to step through each category and outline some of the free resources I find useful to gather data and information.  This will assist you with informing your decision for Step 2- which I find is always the hardest part of the process. 

**1. Revenue** 

 Is the protocol generating revenue? This is like analysing companies on the stock market- you want strong growth and increasing revenue that delivers value back to the shareholders. Good businesses all have strong revenue streams.

Crypto Projects can generate revenue in many ways 

*  Transaction fees 
* Trading fees 
* Liquidation fees 
* Staking fees 
* GameFi mechanics

[Token terminal](https://tokenterminal.com/) and [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/) are great websites to find data relating to revenue and protocol fees.

&#x200B;

**2. Treasury**  

What is in the protocol’s treasury? How much runway has the project got before they burn through their reserves. Projects need to pay for devs, marketing, partnerships, listings etc.

Bigger is better here and diversity of assets in the treasury is also key. You don't want a treasury that is too concentrated with the projects own token (remember FTT and LUNA?)

Again, Token terminal is a great website for treasury findings.

&#x200B;

**3. Tokenomics**  

Ask yourself these key questions  

* Is the token supply capped? 
* How many tokens have been issued? 
* Are there any buybacks/ burn mechanisms?

[coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), [messari](https://messari.io/) and project whitepapers are some of the great resources for researching tokenomics.

&#x200B;

**4. Locked up funds**  

This category is closely linked to tokenomics. Sometimes projects will offer incentives for people to lock up their token and receive higher rewards (Staking fees etc). This reduces buying pressure on the token and increases long-term sustainability. 

On the other hand, it’s important to consider vesting schedules and token unlocks to see if there will be large amounts of sell pressure in the future. There is a large amount of tokens being unlocked in 2023 for dYdX. Similarly, a lot of tokens of Algo got unlocked in 2021.

&#x200B;

**5. Use Case**  

What is the project/ tokens use case and utility? Why does it exist and how does it provide value? What problems does it solve?  If something is  useful, more and more people will use it, leading to greater adoption and network effects. 

My favourite place to look at this is [DefiLlama](https://twitter.com/DefiLlama) dashboards where you can get all the TVL and DeFi stats you would ever need. 

&#x200B;

**6. Roadmap**  

You have found an awesome project, but do they have a clear and strategic direction for the future? Good projects will execute and hit key dates/ milestones and update their roadmap with new initiatives. 

[MessariCrypto](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto) and project whitepaper are good resources here.

&#x200B;

**7. Team/ Funding**  

Who is the team made up of?  

* Are they doxxed 
* Experience in Web3 
* Active on socials      
* Code being published on GitHub 
* NO CULT LEADERS  


Who has invested in the project in the early stages? If the project is backed by prominent investors/ VCs then it increases its chance of success.   Although as we have seen lately with FTX, this is not always the case as institutional money can get it wrong. 

This is a framework, and you can make changes in yours, as per your requirement.

For reference the current average fee for a transaction is about $1 so they paid 61,000 X over the odds to include this transaction in the block.

Reasons: Either someone made a massive mistake or some miner knew they would mine this block and included the massive fee to obscure the source of the funds - essentially laundering the fee and claiming it as legitimate income, totally unconnected to the original illegitimate funds.

This is made possible as miners can choose which transactions to include in the block they are attempting to mine and don't neccesarily need to broadcast their own transactions to the network first which would allow every other miner to see it and (obviously) want to include it in their block.  


>Miners “assemble” blocks by putting transactions in them. Usually those transactions come from the mempool but they don’t have to. Miners can manually add transactions to their own blocks without having the transaction broadcast to the mempool.",2022-12-15 14:11:03

We all have heard the FUD spread around internet about Binance exchange, well it's not the first time when the big whales are trying to lower the price just to buy cheaper and surely it will not be the last. CZ have nicely explained everything on twitter, we are also able to see all the money which Binance possess to cover big withdrawals like the one in this week, it is alao not the first time its happening. I strongly believe with all the assets, all the ideas and with how far Binance has come over the few years of existence I can only say that Binance is the exchange that will survive for very long, obviously I don't know for how long, but I believe our kids and even maybe grandkids will be trading on Binance in future.

Pricewise BNB dropped a bit this week, its not the end of the world, we are still in bear market, I would say it will get back to $300 in January.

You dont have to listen to my trust me bro advice as its not a financial advice post, but if I would need to use a CEX, I would definitely use Binance.",2022-12-15 14:09:05

This obviously is justified as AML and anti-drug trafficking prevention and so on, just like when they say that bitcoin is only used for drugs, criminal stuff and terrorism.

This is now more actively talked and enforced since the total collapse of FTX, giving them even more reasons to push regulations in a more restrictive way, so it won't be an easy fight against zero privacy proponents like E. Warren.

"The ANTI-SHILL post for COSMOS. Why the project could fail, and how the data tells that story.",153,zmi0a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmi0a1/the_antishill_post_for_cosmos_why_the_project/,335,1671100463.0,"**WHAT**:

A couple of days ago, I wrote a scathing review of Algorand outlining why it will fail. I have also done negative posts for Solana, Cryptocom and even Ethereum in the past.

In that thread, a user asked me to provide the same sort of negative perspective for COSMOS, and I thought it was an intriguing idea. I also appreciated that it was someone invested in COSMOS asking for a negative post to be produced - it is a good thing to constantly challenge yourself and not ""marry a token"". 

**RATIONALE**:

Based on the user suggestion, I decided to trial my own ANTI-SHILL series. I have no intention to upset people, and would invite commenters heavily in projects to challenge/clarify the data provided. The overall benefit being that some users will either question their investments or have their beliefs ratified by others. Or better yet, if I cannot find any good reasons to ANTI-SHILL, then maybe this could be a project worth considering.

If this type of post is recived well by members, I will try to do it for other requested major cryptos.

**DISCLOSURE**:

I do not currently hold COSMOS, nor am I an expert in anything. I am a crypto degenerate.

**DATA SOURCES:**

Since I'm trying to build this as a series, I'm going to try keep some of the types of evidence and the format consistent, it will include information like supply, usage and decentralisation. 

&#x200B;

*So here it is, the anti-shill for COSMOS.*

**THE ANTI-SHILL FOR COSMOS:**

&#x200B;

**INFLATION - Much too high. Staking rewards do not offset the supply increase.**

There is a significant discrepancy between the inflation calculated by Messari and CoinMarketCap versus the stated inflation from the various Cosmos ecosystem scanners.

Whether it is because of some hidden lock mechanic for some tokens, and since these values are suppose to represent the circulating supply, it is not a good look for investors to have to justify why the stated inflation does not match the calculated one.

The staking rewards are averaged at 21.57% which is below the calculated inflation value, but above the stated inflation value.  The staking rewards [claimed on the COSMOS website](https://cosmos.network/learn/staking) also state the average APY is less than ten percent, which is significantly lower than the stated inflation.

There is a different incentive to holding which is airdrops. Depending on snapshots, you could get lucky with an airdrop that goes ballistic. 

&#x200B;

|SOURCE|INFLATION|SUPPLY TODAY|SUPPLY LAST YEAR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|[Messari](https://messari.io/asset/cosmos/chart/sply-circ)|26.60 %|286,370,297|226,186,564|
|[Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/)|26.66 %|286,370,297|226,127,431|

|[Cosmoscan](https://cosmoscan.net/cosmos)|13.81 %|319,984,721.29|Not provided|

&#x200B;

**UTILITY - Limited use. There is no reason to hold the token other than speculation**

There is actually very little utility for the ATOM token.  [By staking ATOM, you are able to vote in Cosmos Hub governance decisions, but that is about it](https://cosmos.network/learn/faq/what-is-the-atom). There doesn't seem to be much reason to actually hold it other than it might go up or down and thus you could sell it. For context, other projects require their token to be used for fees or NFT sales. According to [cryptofees](https://cryptofees.info/), the COSMOS chain doesn't seem to actually make any money, the projects built on it do - which still doesn't seem to give a reason to hold ATOM.

&#x200B;

**DAILY ACTIVITY - It is a mystery!**

Try as I might, I could not find statistics anywhere about how many addresses are actually being used on the COSMOS chain. To me, this is a massive red flag. I can find transactions on [several sites](https://atomscan.com/stats/transactions/volume) quite easily, but not being able to find statistics showing me the total number of wallets created, and what percentage of them are currently being used seems impossible. This is a massive issue in terms of transparency on the chain.

[Transactions](https://preview.redd.it/rfwzv44bd16a1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=b25138a4864b39ec8bcf63c72fe7ce69a15499fa)

For what its worth, the average transactions seems fairly consistent, but until I can see the number of wallets that are active, I have no way of knowing if any of these are real users, bots, or just staking rewards.

&#x200B;

**MARKETCAP DOMINANCE - Falling all year**

Obviously the entire crypto asset class is down this year, but if you compare like for like, you can still get a sense of whether the token is holding up well or not.

The [marketcap dominance for COSMOS](https://messari.io/asset/cosmos/chart/mcap-dom) is roughly half of what it was at the beginning of the year. Reaching a top of around 0.6 % of the Crypto market in February, it now sits at 0.3 %. All altcoins will lose dominance in a bear market, but you would want the crypto to hold its own in the class as much as possible. Dropping 50% is not a good thing.

The dominance picked up prior to the announcement of 2.0, but has since fallen away again.

[Marketcap dominance](https://preview.redd.it/m4ofdtugd16a1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=f747ae520481b7e90c7d9a55fc2e372b8c04e2be)

&#x200B;

**TOTAL VALUE LOCKED - Where is it?**

This value helps understand how many people are staking COSMOS and in a sense how commited investors are to the project. Yet once again this is a figure that is difficult to ascertain. 

According to DefiLlama, [there is no reported TVL directly for the ATOM token](https://defillama.com/chains/Cosmos). Once again, they list all the projects built on top of the blockchain. The bonded tokens provided on mintscan also seem to correlate to this value. The highest individual TVL seems to [CRONOS or KAVA](https://defillama.com/chains), but I personally dont believe the locked tokens on an individual project on a blockchain should count towards the TVL on another chain. This is not necessarily a bad thing about the TVL for the ecosystem, but it begs the question again, what is the point of holding the ATOM token?

&#x200B;

[Total Value Locked](https://preview.redd.it/b2zkx41od16a1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=f987f9afc4e0181865aec8898090dc92afbdf608)

&#x200B;

**DECENTRALISATION - Some validators have too much control of the network**

There are currently [\~175 validators](https://atomscan.com/validators) which is gives a [Nakamoto Co-efficient](https://nakaflow.io/) of just 7. This is roughly the same level of decentralisation as Binance and is a terrible score. COSMOS really needs to increase the numbers of validators quickly because the distribution of tokens across the staking validators is a significant risk.

[Nakamoto Coefficient](https://preview.redd.it/0yrrue5sd16a1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c4e07f272c8e330e3e472ba72b0d3ef3cdf663)

&#x200B;

**BIGGEST COMPETITION - Polkadot still higher in most cases**

All cryptos are essentially in some sort of competition with each other. Due to the rationale, goals and purpose the blockchain, the biggest competitor to COSMOS is likely POLKADOT.

Again, the crypto asset class is down, by comparing marketcap dominance, Polkadot is still more than double the marketcap of COSMOS.

While Polkadot actually has about half the number of validators as COSMOS, the staking mechanism results in a much better Nakamoto-Coefficient of 85. This means [Polkadot is 12 times more decentralised than Cosmos](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-solana-is-more-decentralized-than-you-think-d3710249a92).

&#x200B;

[Nakamoto Coefficient of Polkadot](https://preview.redd.it/hcp2efope16a1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f12d7ca652e59e0b3e567caf9ab7f2c3d00142a6)

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

Holding the ATOM token is pretty much only for speculation - you may get some free stuff or see the price rise. 

 

**TLDR: Just read the bold headlines**

**DISCLAIMER:**

I'll always state whether I am involved in the project or not, but you should never trust the word of a degenerate user on Reddit. On top of people shilling their own bags, looking for liquidity exits, there are paid promoters and employers and affiliates in this sub already.

**IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS:**

The data is publicly available on sites like CoinGecko, CoinMarketcap, Messari and IntoTheBlock, and should be verified on chain. Don't trust me bro.

**PLEASE SHOW RESPECT TO OTHERS:**

Obviously when telling someone their favourite crypto is bad will illicit some negative emotions, especially if they are very heavily invested. I ask that all commenters try to respect each other's opinions and not downvote ""just because you don't like it"". If you disagree, respond with facts - justify your point, and agree to disagree if necessary.",2022-12-15 12:34:23

Here is his testimony under oath where he said this  to the question ""Why did FTX fail"": https://twitter.com/Benzinga/status/1603076399593844736

Lets get this straight - he said FTX didnt fail because of fraud, laundering user deposits into personal accounts or into their own hedge fund to make risky trades, bought expensive condos with customer deposits and just ran the most incompetent bucketshop ever possible etc, but because ""Binance put FTX out of business""

In stark contrast, the main bankruptcy professional and new FTX  CEO John Ray told the House yesterday that FTX collapse was the result of old fashioned fraud. He was asked if Binance caused this, he flatly said NO. 

In the testimony to House, he was asked by Rep Gonzalez (at time 2:43:30),

> Rep Gonzalez: One of the things in Mr.  Bankman-fried's testimony that has  leaked, that wasn't submitted, is he spends time  talking about Binance and how Binance  created a run on the bank, suggesting that, had that not occurred, FTX was solvent and would have been just fine.  Prior to that episode -- is it your belief that FTX  was solvent? 

> Mr. John Ray: NO


You can listen to the testimony here and forward to the time mentioned above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ObdFaUL7nc&t=9795s

Also this entire testimony of John Ray pretty much outlines how SBF was running a fraudulent shop for months. John who has now assumed control of FTX and is in an authoritative position to tell us what went wrong at FTX quite simply states the whole enterprise was a fraud. The DoJ, SEC and CFTC have already filed charges against SBF, but here we have Kevin O'Leary telling the Senate that SBF is innocent but its Binance put FTX out of business. 

Whats really dangerous is that Kevin knows this is not true, yet goes onto Senate to state lies under oath. He has worked his entire career in finance. He knows that John Ray has the best knowledge to put together what happened at FTX. He knows investigations of multiple agencies have put the blame on SBF. Yet he goes and tries to whitewash SBF's crimes. 

Kevin O'Leary is a conman, who last week even said he would continue to do business with SBF. This week SBF got arrested, yet Kevin is still lying to the Senate. He got paid $15 M to be a shill for SBF. Its a shameful joke that he was even called up to testify in this issue. Its like inviting Ted Bundy's spokesperson to the Senate so that he can whitewash his crimes. Such actions dont make Ted Bundy or SBF look any better, but it just diminishes the respect of the Senate as an institution. 

This guy deserves to be in the same cell as SBF. Every penny paid by SBF to this fraudster must be clawed back to make FTX depositors whole.",2022-12-15 11:24:34

Why I Believe Cryptocurrency is the Future of Money,0,zmdqo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmdqo8/why_i_believe_cryptocurrency_is_the_future_of/,63,1671084091.0," Hey everyone! I know there's a lot of debate about the value and legitimacy of cryptocurrency, but I wanted to share why I personally believe it is the future of money.

First, let's talk about the problems with traditional fiat currency. It is subject to inflation, can be manipulated by governments and banks, and is not easily transferable across borders. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is decentralized and operates on a secure, global network of computers. This means that it is not subject to the same limitations and can be easily transferred without the need for intermediaries like banks.

Another advantage of cryptocurrency is its limited supply. Most cryptocurrencies have a maximum supply that will ever be created, which means that they are not subject to the same inflation risks as fiat currency. This also makes them a potentially more stable store of value.

Finally, the technology behind cryptocurrency, known as blockchain, has a wide range of potential uses beyond just digital currency. It has the potential to revolutionize industries from supply chain management to voting systems.

I know there are still a lot of unknowns and uncertainties when it comes to cryptocurrency, but I truly believe it is the future of money. What do you all think?",2022-12-15 08:01:31
The future of cryptocurrency is bright - here's why,0,zmdpen,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zmdpen/the_future_of_cryptocurrency_is_bright_heres_why/,32,1671084001.0," Hello fellow cryptocurrency enthusiasts!

As you know, the world of crypto can be unpredictable and volatile. But despite the ups and downs, I believe that the future of cryptocurrency is bright.

First, let's look at the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency. More and more businesses and institutions are starting to accept crypto as a legitimate form of payment. This is a huge step towards mainstream adoption, and it shows that people are starting to see the value in using cryptocurrency.

Second, we're seeing the development of new technologies that are making it easier and safer to use crypto. For example, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) has made it possible for people to access financial services without having to go through traditional banks. This opens up a world of possibilities for those who are unbanked or underbanked.

Third, the potential for cryptocurrency to revolutionize the global financial system cannot be overstated. With the ability to transfer value quickly and securely without the need for intermediaries, crypto has the potential to make the financial system more inclusive and accessible to everyone.

In short, while there may be bumps along the way, I'm confident that the future of cryptocurrency is bright. What do you think? Let's discuss in the comments!

Thanks for reading, and happy crypto-ing!",2022-12-15 08:00:01

\- Was fully build with the earnings from Chivo Wallet (Gov Bitcoin Wallet) by the Gov, and it is still run but them.

\- When you book and get services, this are really cheap, usually $0.25 per ""item"" giving you a total of like $15 for a full vet treatment.

* The company had 6 or so luxury condos for employees to use, free-of-charge. Stays at luxury hotels were also expensed by FTX.

* Staff worked Monday through Sunday, and were shouted at for requesting holidays off.

* Sam brought in a mental health specialist to treat employee fatigue. This person is said to be a family friend of the Bankman-Frieds. There are allegations that the psych frequently asked Danielle about her sex life, and informed her that his wife would not mind if he cheated (yikes).

* Allegations that FTX admin illegally shipped drugs to Nassau, with prescriptions being filled in California and Florida

* Everyone at FTX knew the ""effective altruism"" persona was bullshit.

* FTX failed to meet its charitable commitments. Sam's father told staff the money would be better spent on legal fees.

FTX was one of the biggest and most profitable crypto exchanges ever made, bringing crypto to the masses & showing that consumer adoption was closer than we all thought. 
In the space of just 3 years, FTX accomplished what many smaller and larger exchanges failed to do – with trading volumes at an all time high during FTX’s rise. 

News recently broke that the owner of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been brought into custody. While the full trial and court case will reveal all in the coming days, it’s clear that he has made many bad investment opportunities and wasn’t running the company to his full potential.

If it becomes law, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act will bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.

The act would also allow the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement a proposed rule requiring institutions to report certain transactions involving unhosted wallets – wallets where the user has complete control over the contents rather than relying on an exchange or other third party.

But even though we're in a ""crypto winter,"" that doesn't mean we should give up on investing in cryptocurrency. In fact, now may be the perfect time to start building your crypto portfolio.

One of the biggest benefits of investing in cryptocurrency during a bear market is the potential for huge gains when the market turns around. When the market is down, prices are low, which means you can buy more coins for your money. And when the market eventually recovers, those coins could be worth much more, leading to big returns on your investment.

Another benefit is that the crypto market is still relatively young and unproven. That means there's plenty of room for growth and innovation, which could lead to exciting new projects and opportunities for investors.

Finally, investing in cryptocurrency can be a great way to diversify your investment portfolio. The crypto market is largely uncorrelated with the stock market, which means it can provide a hedge against traditional market volatility.

So, even though the crypto winter may be keeping some investors on the sidelines, don't let that discourage you. Now may be the perfect time to start building your crypto portfolio and taking advantage of the unique opportunities that the crypto market has to offer.",2022-12-15 02:47:44
Here are what saved me from all of the 2022 collapses,1,zm5ppo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zm5ppo/here_are_what_saved_me_from_all_of_the_2022/,18,1671060538.0,"Several major crypto exchanges and platforms went bankrupt in 2022, causing investors $billions in losses. Fortunately, I was never a victim of any of them because for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

1. **Mostly in DeFi.** First I maintain custody of all my assets in my hot and cold wallets and I trade primarily on DEXes when. The only time my money or coins enter an exchange is when I'm buying with fiat or cashing out or when I need to convert from one chain to another.
2. **Invests only where I'm confident.** One of my investment policies is that if you cannot confidently explain where the rewards you're earning on a platform are coming from, don't put your money on it. Furthermore, if it looks and feels like a Ponzi scheme, it most likely is. Except if you're interested in gambling, a 20% APR on a stablecoin deposit (UST) was a bad signal and that's one thing that kept me from investing in it until it finally collapsed. The same applies to some of the centralised lending platforms. They can't be making so much profit consistently to guarantee the high rewards they pay out. 
3. **Always follow my gut.** I had an unverified account with FTX for almost a year but never funded it for trading because something just didn't sit well with me about the exchange. The only time my money went through FTX is when I had to move some funds to Arbitrum and the exchange was the most reasonable option available to me. Except it collapsed at that very moment of moving my funds in one way and out another, I couldn't be affected by its insolvency. If it doesn't feel right to keep your money there, don't.

The only losses are the market-wide crashes that these failed projects caused leading to significant loss of value of most crypto assets I HODL.

Were you as ""lucky"" as I am during all of the 2022 shenanigans? How did you make it through and if you fell victim to one or more of these platforms, what lessons did you learn? Please share.

And as we all know, when the tide rises, all the boats rise. Of course, this doesn’t conclusively mean that the bull market will happen next year, but I would rather believe in something and be proven wrong than not to take action on anything at all. So this is what I’m doing these days:

1. Reading books like “The Hour Between Dog and Wolf” (by John Coates) so that I can learn how to master my emotions better and be impeccably calm and collected always

2. Finding out more about the different wallets available (Exodus is a multicoin wallet, unlike Metamask which is a Ethereum multichain wallet) as well as the wallets that empower users to do on-chain staking. Staking is the best form of passive income ever! 

3. Committing to a decision to slowly accumulate those coins that I think would do well in the next bull run. Even using faucets to get some crypto dust whenever I have a spare moment to keep my mind focused on the endeavour 

4. Reading up more about decentralised exchanges and the unique selling proposition of each. Thankful that the migration of moons onto the mainnet allowed me to try out SushiSwap for the first time. Keen to see how I could optimise my investments with wrapped cryptocurrencies

The sentiment around Crypto right now is exactly what is needed for it to possibly bottom.,3,zm3h4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zm3h4o/the_sentiment_around_crypto_right_now_is_exactly/,19,1671055027.0,"This has indeed been hell of a year. We started off with ""maybe it's still a bull market"" and have ended up in this crypto ice age and second-most brutal bear market in crypto history. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions with many events making more and more people leave crypto altogether as they just did not believe to make any gains now again with crypto and an abnormally high amount of them has sold on losses.

This kind of complete capitulation is what is needed for a crypto bottom to possibly form. Mainstream has capitulated long ago, institutions have capitulated mostly, miners are capitulating right now and even some hardcore Crypto enthusiasts have left the markets. Situation such as the  LUNA implosion and not the FTX collapse have shown us peak fear.

Obviously this all is just speculations as the sheer possibility that we could exist in a good pint to forn a bottom does not mean that we can not go down another 50% nor matter what. But it is very apparent that it will take more an more sell-power for fewer and fewer price decreases as we could see with this FTX collapse in comparison to LUNA earlier this year.

A bottom formations does also not mean that we will have a bottom overnigjt but it will take a lot of time and those are usually the time people leave due to boredom. But if we all got until here, we should not be scared down by a bit boredom...",2022-12-14 23:57:07

I don't why many of you keep saying that people telling people to withdraw their assets from Binance are spreading FUD. 

NO FUD here. If the exchange keeps customers' backed at a 1:1 ratio, they shouldn't be worrying if ppl are withdrawing their assets. In fact it is another way around, because it shows that they could honour their customers' withdrawal.

Again, to me, there is not enough 'not your key not your crypto'. The first thing you should learn when getting into crypto is self-custody your own assets. 

Like Andreas M. Antonopoulos said, exchange is only the place where you trade, when you are done with trading, withdraw your crypto ASAP. That's simple.",2022-12-14 23:56:46

"SBF's planned Congressional testimony included screenshots from a private channel showing that CZ, SBF, and others collaborate (illegally?) behind the scenes to prop up certain coins over others",420,zm309l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zm309l/sbfs_planned_congressional_testimony_included/,196,1671053884.0,"[Link to testimony](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/13/exclusive-transcript-the-full-testimony-sbf-planned-to-give-to-congress/?sh=28d204e13c47)

Most of the coverage of SBF's planned (and undelivered) testimony to Congress focused on his (bullshit) attempts to blame everyone from CZ to the Chapter 11 lawyers to FTX's own counsel for its demise. However, buried in his testimony is something far more interesting: he includes screenshots from a chat named ""Exchange coordination"" in which he and CZ have a conversation.

I would post high-res pics so we can easily read them, but the source material is low-res so there's no point. Here are the screengrabs SBF included in his testimony:

[link to screens, slightly better res than Forbes](https://imgur.com/a/OyQTTCQ)

In that conversation, CZ chastises SBF for shorting Tether (a $250k short), instructs SBF to pause withdrawals only for TRON, and to otherwise do nothing.

This doesn't sound like a big deal, except we must remember:

1. CZ and Binance are ""officially"" not related to Tether. Why does CZ care if SBF is shorting a product his exchange is officially unaffiliated with? And why is it a problem at all, if Tether is fully backed? If it's fully backed, any short will inevitably lose.

2. CZ is complaining about a $250k short, in a Tether market which is supposedly $60bn+. Why did he even know about it? Why does the CEO of binance even know about a single hedge fund making such a miniscule bet? Why does he care, and why did it even reach his attention? This is a completely insignificant trade.

3. CZ tells SBF to pause withdrawals for TRON, and tags Justin Sun. Why, again, is CZ concerned with a product his company is not officially affiliated with? Why does he want to protect TRON, but not other coins? 

4. It's almost certainly illegal for there to be an ""exchange coordination"" chat in which participants coordinate their market actions. That's the definition of market manipulation, and if I'm a prosecutor, I want to subpoena that chat and everyone linked to it immediately. When was that chat set up, was anything else coordinated, and who in total was in it?

5. Finally, the real zinger: why did SBF include the screenshots? Was he trying to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for prosecutors to follow such that they bring down CZ with him? Or is he truly just so arrogantly stupid that he thinks this somehow helps his case?

CZ's actions, to me, indicate that USDT is on way shakier ground than people think. Why else would he care about a $250k bet? And it also indicates that binance has some agreement with Tron, such that CZ / binance would lose money if Tron were actually allowed to undergo non-Binance price discovery.

I realize this is just a bunch of questions, but these are damn good questions! This portion of the testimony deserves way more attention, because it reveals a LOT about how things actually worked. We get to go beyond SBF's saintly victimhood claims to see that some to possibly most exchanges coordinate actions, that their CEOs presumably regularly chat to handle those actions, and that they're doing so out of self-interest. It would not surprise me in the slightest if, somewhere in that chat or in its participants' DMs, there's outright price manipulation being discussed.",2022-12-14 23:38:04

Liquidity will be nowhere to be found. I don't know, nobody does, if the bottom has been reached or not, I personally believe that with a 5.1% rate, the bottom is not in yet. But we'll see. One of the **most important aspects for crypto investors is that the** **HALVENING in 2024 plays along with a positive overall improvement of the stock market**.

Considering that no swam event takes place (that's a lot of assuming), BTC halving can benefit from a real pivot in the monetary policy of the FED. So, **theoretically, DCA for all of 2023 will be a great year, and we could be flooded and harvesting our riches in 2024 and 2025.**

We in Europe are much more f\*\*\* than you American guys, if the war stopped situation would play completely differently, but who the f\*\*\*\* knows that?

I can easily use Etherscan and all other blockchains easily with my main wallet address but when I added secondary accounts and got different wallet addresses under the same seed phrase ALL of my secondary accounts are gone and seemingly unrecoverable.

      I deleted my wallet because I had accumulated so many junk wallets over the years with little to no coins or NFTs. Also I wasn’t sure if I’ve ever accidentally stored my seed phrase in an unsafe place like a snapshot that then got sent to the cloud. Which most people who invest in crypto know can be easily accessed by someone who is determined and know what they are doing. I pretty much ignored this tbh until I looked into the subject further and realized just how vulnerable my assets really were.

      So after deleting my wallet I started a process of importing all of my known seed phrases into MetaMask. As I was finishing this process it occurred to me that I was missing ALL of my NFTs. I guess by chance and not knowing exactly how MetaMask worked at the time I was depositing some of my coins and I’ll be damned ALL of my NFTs into secondary accounts.

        I have no idea how to get back some valuable NFTs, Reddit Avatars included, which are my favorite NFTs. The idea is to put all of my crypto into one safe wallet that I have never used and has yet to be created. I’m creating an absolutely secure vault of a wallet that I know that I am the only person on the planet to know the seed phrase for 100000% sure.

2022 was a challenging year for risky investments. It started with FED's news about increasing rates. The next FED meeting began with a 25 basis points hike, and keep increasing to 75 basis points next FED meetings. Today with a smaller rate hike than the last one was a sign that inflation is getting better.

**What does that mean for CryptoCurrencies?**

* Raising rates makes it costly to take out a loan, causing people to borrow and spend less. So it's still costly to take out a loan, and that means still less money flow to risky investments like cryptocurrencies.
* **But** for investors, a lower rate hike is pretty good news, and they will add more risky assets like cryptocurrencies to their investments since they get it like things getting better. That would start a new bull run cycle of the crypto market if rate hikes keep lowering every FED meeting.

Some people like to have their assets easily exchangeable without a dozen wallet transfers, some like to day trade, don’t want to buy a hardware wallet, etc. They may not want the “financial advice” that we’re all careful not to give, and that’s their prerogative. Their assets are potentially at risk, but half the people here have learned how to properly store crypto because they’ve been victims of that risk. 

To expand on that point, exchanges are where the majority of people start to trade. It’s where the new people enter the crypto space and buy the coins they want.  **This is where adoption happens** - by putting it all in a nice little website for the people who don’t want to work their ass off to figure out how to buy an ETH token or download a dozen apps to transfer money back and forth. (Again, I’m not one of those people)

By actively rooting for exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to go under, you’re rooting against the ease of access to cryptocurrencies for those just entering the space.

American University Washington College of Law Professor Hilary J. Allen:

* ""Crypto can be made out of thin air"". Yes this is right. So be the dollars, or bonds, shares, among other financial assets. What is more important that is completely omitted from this argument? You can make something out of thin air. But what really drives its value? It's the underlying technology and the eco-system.
* ""The blockchain technology itself can never deliver its promises"". And yes, she mentioned Defi, one of the most important and innovative financial products in modern time.
* ""Blockchain is not transparent. Lots of backdoor and off-chain transactions can't be traced"". Yes, that exactly is the problem of traditional finance and the very reason why this FTX debacle started in the first place. Had blockchain been used properly, this would have never happened. How can you really trace a transaction in a blockchain if it has never taken place in that blockchain anyway?

Then we have the mighty Kevin O:

* ""FTX failed because of Binance"". I have to admire the way this folk making his case. He started with a father-and-son story when he asked SBF ""where did the money go"", and SBF said ""I basically spent money to buy back Binance's FTX shares so that I have my freedom to grow my business"". It's just extraordinary listening to this guy, a litterally FTX-paid spoke person. My question for him: ""Do you think that SBF scammed people, and you are certainly a big part of this whole scheme?"".

It's incredible in many ways. And I can see there'll be a rough time ahead for crypto as a whole.",2022-12-14 20:35:08

This is the follow up.

The question involved trades that would get you a significant amount of BTC. In my example, I used 0.1+ BTC as a lower threshold. There were around 667 comments, of which 161 were answers that could be classified as the following:

* Yes
* No
* Partially (e.g. not all the MOON bag)
* Not for BTC
* Only if my bag could buy me 1 BTC

The results are shown in the following graph:

Some comments didn't explicitly say ""yes"" or ""no"", but could be classified as either, e.g. ""who wouldn't?"" was classified as ""yes"", whereas ""I'm happy with my moons"" was classified as ""no"".

Some of the people willing to not sell had a higher amount of moons, e.g. 5k+. However, no correlation test was run.

# tl;dr

Majority of respondents would not trade their MOONs for BTC, considering yes or no answers alone. If you consider that the moons could be traded for 1+ BTC or not necessarily for BTC, most respondents would trade them.

Binance is super sneaky and makes withdrawals into the BNB chain cheaper than withdrawing into the native ecosystem. This is a shady and intentional move by Binance so they can...

* pump assets into the BNB chain

Never withdrawal crypto into the BNB chain to hold long term, especially if you're trying to get your crypto away from Binance. If Binance were to hypothetically fail because they didn't have adequate reserves to back withdrawals all tokens backed by Binance would also become worthless.

In that even Binance is not spared, the biggest crypto exchange and one of the first to call for proof of reserves (even though they still did not do a complete one).

Binance saw yesterday the largest outflow of Bitcoin from their exchange with 39.6k BTC and the largest outflow of stablecoins with a massive $2.1B, including their house-own stablecoin BUSD.

It is also important to mention that, as we can see,actually any kind of a outflow in this magnitude during a price-crash is very unusual. Typically, during a price-crash people tend to deposit assets to exchanges to leave the markets through a fiat off-ramp.

Thus, such outflows clearly show that people are withdrawing right now to take self-custody of their crypto and all this is due to the recent events in crypto and nothing else.",2022-12-14 19:44:56

How to prevent:

By Adjusting the length of wallet addresses shown in the transaction history and by filtering and hiding 0 transfers on EVM chains and Tron from wallet records.

[SERIOUS] Trading Demystified - Risk Management,0,zlvhak,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlvhak/serious_trading_demystified_risk_management/,6,1671035516.0,"A couple of days ago I started a series of posts in a quest to penetrate the wall of ignorance that this community has towards trading. The following text is the continuation of that quest... [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zedck8/serious\_trading\_demystified\_intro/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zedck8/serious_trading_demystified_intro/)

**On Topic of Risk Management**

...A good trader does not chase big wins, big wins come to him. The goal is to live to see those big wins. To put it in other words the ultimate goal of a trader is not to maximize wins, but to minimize losses.

This is where risk management comes in. Number one reason why traders fail is poor risk management or a complete absence of one. Beginer traders often enter trades without any plan or stop losses. They witness huge swings in profit/drawdown and are completely driven by emotions. It is not an exception but a rule, that unprepared traders WILL lose all their money eventually.

So.. how does one manage risk?

The first thing that comes to mind regarding risk management are stop losses. While essential, SLs are only a part of a story. Take profit (TP) targets are equally important. No trade should ever be opened without a well defined SL and TP target.

Once TP and SL are known the position size should be calculated. Why? Because we want to limit risk in case our trade idea was bad (which is mostly the case). The percentage of SL is completely irrelevant, what is relevant is **position size** in regard of your stop loss.

(One thing to note. Leverage is completely irrelevant. Position size is only thing that matters. Leverage is just a tool that allows you to reach appropriate position size without having to have your entire portfolio on a CEX.)

Example:

[Trade example with $1000 account, risking 1&#37; per trade](https://preview.redd.it/4fkhfwpl4w5a1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0e25aaacd2747b128a6f3c379e237f9ce2d92a6)

So this is example for one trade. But there is more... what if you are on a bad streak? Should you continue to trade... should you increase the risk to quickly recover your losses?

&#x200B;

The answer to this is a **risk management system**.

Below is an example of a strict (good) risk management system.

*- Risk only 1% per trade*

*- After two consecutive losses, the risk is halved to 0.5%. If two more losses occur risk is further reduced to 0.25%. Risk is then gradually increased back to 1% as the losses are recovered*

*- If a daily drawdown of 2% is reached, trading is stopped for the day*

*- If the price reaches target without getting you into a position, orders are cancelled.*

&#x200B;

Ultimately you don't need big win rate to be profitable. You need a good set of rules and a strict risk management. There are very, very successful traders with less than 20% win rate. The key to their success - they cut their losses early.

There is a saying that goes something like this - Equip a monkey with good risk management system and he will outtrade any retail trader in existence.

Senator Warren just introduced a bill titled ""Crypto Anti Money Laundering Bill"" that has major ramifications on how crypto will be treated.

It seeks to classify every crypto entity including wallets, nodes, validators, dapps, developers etc as ""money service businesses"" and forces FinCEN to regulate these. This means all of these crypto entities would have to introduce KYC norms.

The most damaging aspect of this bill is this section:

>**The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network shall promulgate a rule classifying custodial and unhosted wallet providers, cryptocurrency miners, validators, or other nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including MEV searchers, and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses.**


According to this bill,

1. Both custodial and non-custodial (unhosted wallets)
2. Miners, validators, ""other nodes"" who may validate or secure third party transactions
3. Independent network participants including MEV searchers
4. ""Other validators""

Will all become MSB i.e money service businesses.

MSB's are already regulated: https://www.fincen.gov/money-services-business-definition

Every MSB must comply with these regulations, which include obtaining registrations,  KYC of all its users. etc. 

> Each money services business (MSB) is a financial institution. 

So this bill seeks to treat every miner or validator or node or wallet as a financial institution. This means even wallets would have to comply with stringent AML laws. At this point it does not appear clearly as to how wallets will even track KYC of all its users. This would probably outlaw self custody wallets since they have no way to track KYC of its users. I mean, how will electrum or metamask KYC its users? 

This bill effectively outlaws privacy coins like Monero and makes all kinds of mixers and privacy tools illegal - because such privacy chains and tools cannot possibly comply with these regulations. Edit: Actually, its much worse - it straight up prohibits dealing with any kind of ""anonymity enhancing technique"". This bill flat out prohibits privacy coins. 


Here is the part of the bill that totally prohibits all kinds of privacy:

> Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promulgate a rule that 

> (1) prohibits financial institutions from handling, using, or transacting business with digital asset mixers, privacy coins, and other anonymity-enhancing technologies, as specified by the Secretary; and 

> (2) handling, using, or transacting business with digital assets that have been anonymized by thetechnologies described in paragraph (1)

Here is the copy of the bill: [https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAAML%20Act%20of%202022.pdf](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAAML%20Act%20of%202022.pdf)

This just happened in the last hour or so, and more reactions are just coming in. Across the board in crypto, everyone is in opposition to this - the bill literally does nothing to prevent scams like the ones we witnessed from happening, but instead will push more people to underground/off shore jurisdictions where other scammers can take advantage of them.

Not many care for the things you feel because you choose a CEX for holding or whatever platform. And you see other CEX’s collapse. Probably for different reasons but eventually its known to be a risky factor to deal with. Mentioning you dont want to FUD is the essence of FUD. 

Take it or leave it but those snowflaky feelings are not constructive at all. Maybe I am talking to paid FUD’ers from competitors, otherwise man up and take responsibility for your investments.

When in doubt, pull out. Degens are not cool, just wreckless and are the first to scream when shit hits the fan.

Choose a CEX and live with it. Or choose DEFI and learn the ropes. Easy. Everything in between or “but” or “what if” is useless to share or debate. At the end nobody knows more than what we can read or observe from here.

DeRec ---- Decentralized Recovery and Custody --- This will be a game changer for all of crypto.,0,zlt3w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlt3w8/derec_decentralized_recovery_and_custody_this/,12,1671029826.0,"DeRec is a way to store your passphrase and makes it recoverable so that there is a secure safety net for anyone no matter how sophisticated you are with the technology. An industry wide adoption and development of this technology would be massive push into decentralizing ownership of coins. 

DeRec is going to need to be agreed upon across the many different platforms to work. I saw this video on it and think its a great idea that needs to be pushed through for wider adoption.  This will open the door for many more people to enter this market and the learning curve about security will not be so long or such a barrier. 

There is a wide audience on r/CC, I was wondering has any other DLT been talking about this technology and trying to develop it?  If so I would love to hear about it. 

Like I said this technology can not be oriented to one project but rather all projects.  But with a secure way to secure your passphrase and a secure recovery method would make centralized storage of coins on an exchange a thing of the past.

Why the biggest CEX collapsing would be good for crypto,0,zlsdck,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlsdck/why_the_biggest_cex_collapsing_would_be_good_for/,42,1671028087.0,"There seems to be confusion and misunderstanding about why some of us want the Central Exchanges (CEXs) to die. Simply put it's because of 2 main reasons:

1. Killing the speculative market 
2. Destroying centralized points of failure

(1) Has a lot of moving parts; which would require a book to cover but I will try my best to explain them. 

The first being the abundance of scams and frauds operating in the space. Most of these can be traced back to a CEX. CEXs main source of income are allegedly fees. The more people involved in speculative trading the better. They achieve this via mass production of Shit-coins ( with no practical use) and marketing. This is why when you look up who is behind most shilled coins it's a CEX investment wing. 

Secondly the CEX don't want actual utility. They want useless shit you 125X leverage trade. People point to the now 15 years with no real killer application and it all can be traced back to CEXs. The machinery of the industry prioritizes ""Get rich schemes"" rather than advancements in financial technology. If the product actually delivered then you would have to deal with real world regulations and transparency. But if it's a coin focused on trading and the end goal is more trading then you are making money for money 

Thirdly its created the ""greed and fear"" market of crypto. Most people will simply hate this post because they are afraid it will devalue their bags. Or like it because it will pump their bags. The CEXs version of crypto is only interested in liquidity! 

We are a community obsessed with price attempting to contribute the least for the most 

If it collapsed yes the liquidity would be gone but so would be the filth holding back real world application. I know there will be some comments about ""on boarding new users"". That's just code for ""new liquidity"". Plus at this point crypto is at a all time low in people's minds due to the actions of CEXs. Maybe we should actually try this decentralised shit 

(2) With the continued collapse of CEXs, lending platforms and DEFI projects associated with them. We now are a centralized market. Crypto to an extent is now unironically under the control of 1 institution (Binance). Maybe even one man (CZ). 

If you truly are in this space because of the core values of crypto, you know why this is bad 

Either the CEXs die or crypto dies. The choice is yours",2022-12-14 16:28:07
My secret KuCoin fear,1,zlsbsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlsbsz/my_secret_kucoin_fear/,26,1671027984.0,"Hi folks, as always, not financial advice and DYOR! I'm not trying to spread FUD here, more trying to unload my angst. It would be my supreme pleasure to be told this fear is impossible to materialize. 

I've been using KuCoin as my main CEX for a while now. I've heard the past rumors, I've also seen many of those rumors get amplified without any justification and ultimately dismissed (remember Otteroo?) In any case I've never had any problems with them and they provide good access to lots of small cap coins. Mostly I just use the CEX as an onramp and for temporary trading, moving everything to my wallet afterwards. Mostly... 

I admit though that back in the heady days of crypto just a few months ago, before all the CEX scandals, I hadn't taken the ""not your keys not your crypto"" to heart, and I staked an uncomfortable amount of ETH right there on KuCoin. That staked ETH is locked on KuCoin and can't be transferred out. I could trade their staked eth token, ""ETH2.0"" for normal ETH, but the exchange rate these days is fluctuating between 0.7-0.8 ETH/ETH2.0. Taking a 30% loss is something I would like to avoid if at all possible. Furthermore, Vitalik recently announced that the Shanghai update allowing unstaking is a top priority and may come as soon as March, so if I can just wait it out a bit longer that would be great. But now we get to my secret fear: If KuCoin is as shady as all these rumors would have us believe, what if they're issuing paper staked ETH? They could just be superficially offering to 'stake' our ETH, take our real ETH and gamble/embezzle with, and issuing their staking token ETH2.0 with absolutely nothing backing it. If that's the case, then the whole house of cards is just waiting on ETH unstaking for the whole thing to collapse. 

I really hope this doesn't happen, and admittedly it will be my own fault if I lose out due to this. But anyway, that's my fear. Hope it doesn't materialize.",2022-12-14 16:26:24

Unlike yesterday's, this hearing will not only talk to other experts/individuals in the field but also is set up to look at crypto much more skeptically.

This is not something though that people should fret or worry about. I would expect to hear a ton of harsh criticisms from this Committee but that is by design. In general, the Senate operates in a much more skeptical manner than the House of Representatives, and this hearing in fact is structured in such a way as to grill the witnesses that are testifying today. Yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was a fact-finding hearing and was designed for representatives to really learn more about what occurred than anything else. 

&#x200B;

The last thing I want to highlight is some Senators on this Committee have previously made it known they are not fans of crypto because it is not centralized. The biggest Senator we should expect to see is Elizabeth Warren with Bernie Sanders also another possible person who may try to wave on to the Committee. Luckily this Committee also has arguably the biggest crypto proponent on it as well as Senator Cynthia Lummis whose questions will be extremely insightful to hear as she is such a staunch advocate for crypto.",2022-12-14 16:03:48

My problem with this is that a decentralized twitter will most likely invite bad actors (bots and scammers alike). Although the idea of a censorship resistant social media platform promotes the idea of free speech and away from the claws of government control and/or company overreach, it's still very hard to control the inflow of users who's purposes would be yet to be known.

Dorsey was against the idea of content takedowns and suspensions. Stating that only the original author should be only one to decide whether or not the created content should be deleted or not.   
Now if this platform goes public, it will most likely be the prerogative of the user on what type of content they will share to the internet.",2022-12-14 15:02:30

A 2022 recap for the Polygon network,69,zlpynb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlpynb/a_2022_recap_for_the_polygon_network/,81,1671021690.0,"2022 has proven to be devastating for the entire crypto market, yet despite prices being in a constant decline, Polygon still managed to score impressive stats and developments. So as a major Polygon supporter, I thought I’d share some of these numbers and developments with you:

&#x200B;

# DeFi:

Despite DeFi taking a big hit in 2022, Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem kept growing in size, diversity, and number of users

* Polygon reached $1 billion dollars in DeFi TVL and now has the 4th highest TVL on the market
* Polygon surpassed 53,000 dApps and this number keeps on growing
* DeFi and derivatives apps and protocols scored major stats:

\- Uniswap on Polygon scored monthly volumes of $4.25 billion and reached a yearly TVL of $100million

\- Gains Network on Polygon scored an average of $80 million in daily trading volume and $21billion in total trading volume

\- SynthFutures on Polygon scored a billion in monthly trading volume

&#x200B;

# NFT market:

NFTs took an ever harder hit than DeFi did yet Polygon actually saw growth in its NFT market compared to 2021 which was a bullish year

* NFT volume on OpenSea on Polygon in 2022 is higher than in 2021
* Reddit NFTs blew with more than 5 million NFTs already minted and hundreds of thousands of NFTs minted daily
* Around 60,000 returning NFT buyers have been witnessed

&#x200B;

# Tech development:

* In one year, Polygon developed more scaling solutions and frameworks (Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Hermez, Polygon Miden, Polygon Zero, Polygon Avail, Polygon ID, Polygon Edge, Polygon Supernets)
* Polygon became the first to ever develop an open-source zkEVM which will benefit Ethereum’s ecosystem

&#x200B;

# Bizdev:

* Polygon dominated the market with major partnerships with companies ranging from tech (Meta, Nothing Phone, HTC), to social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), to payment services (Stripe, PayPal), to fashion brands (Adidas, Prada, D&G), to finance (JP Morgan, Ernst & Young), to entertainment (Disney, NFL), and the list goes on and on…
* A lot of these partnerships saw use cases like Stripe’s and Travala’s payment services and Nothing Phone and HTC’s OS integration

&#x200B;

# Web3 general development:

* Polygon saw a growth increase of 335% in active development teams YTD
* 804% growth in active development teams Y/Y
* 153% growth in API consumption YTD

&#x200B;

And while this isn't a comprehensive list, I think these highlights were more than enough to show that the charts don’t really show the full picture

Despite prices of many alts falling way below their ATH, some chains are still managing to maintain and even grow their activity and development.

This is a true indication of people being interested in the tech and ecosystem, not just prices and profits.",2022-12-14 14:41:30

USA is currently thinking about applying regulation to the crypto-sphere. Because there is no current alternative, and because of things like the FTX scandal, many users will actually agree with such regulation.

Such regulation has in the past brought other issues, and centralisation of authority is not something the crypto world really wants.

What if there were a coin, or service built by the crypto community for regulating, or at least validating the actions of others in the crypto space.

When I found a new broker or coin, I can just go to CRYPTO_REG_SYSTEM and check it's validity and safety. This could function at a worldwide level instead of a country level, and could be decentralised.

Something similar to how TrustPilot works for companies, but hopefully with less bots. 

Perhaps some kind of smart contract could be written where users validate a service with their trust, and deposit some coin there in return for other benefits.

Is this idea stupid, or perhaps someone could help me expand upon it?",2022-12-14 13:52:03

Citi expects a broader focus on decentralization in 2023 following this year’s failings in centralized crypto ventures,5,zlorox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlorox/citi_expects_a_broader_focus_on_decentralization/,17,1671018037.0,"[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/14/citi-says-crypto-market-leverage-open-interest-are-historically-low/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/14/citi-says-crypto-market-leverage-open-interest-are-historically-low/)

The past year in the digital asset market has been characterized by a series of negative shocks, triggered initially by the collapse of Terra/LUNA, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday looking back on the year.

“Leverage, volatility and interest have faded as investors battle with declining prices,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. “Retail interest has broadly diminished as prices have declined,” and this has “coincided with a more general decline in volatility.”

Institutional interest has also declined. This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded-product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.

Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&P 500 index, the report added.

The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius and Voyager were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.

Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.

The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD Coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.

Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.",2022-12-14 13:40:37

I bought my first Bitcoins in 2015 but I always was to lazy to secure my paper wallet and put it into a steel plate. Now its finally secure. I recommend everyone to do this as well. Get your coins out of those exchanges and put them onto a secure hardware wallet like this. SBF has shown us just recently how paramount important it is to keep your own keys safe at home. You can't trust those stupid CEOs who might accidentally lose your keys or commit fraud and steal it.

I queried the ChatGPT AI about crypto price predictions,0,zlnsbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlnsbf/i_queried_the_chatgpt_ai_about_crypto_price/,34,1671014565.0,"I queried ChatGPT, OpenAIs language AI model and asked a few crypto questions. Note, that it is only a language model and was only trained with data before December 2021. I briefed the model to think it is an financial advisor and crypto expert all-knowing AI. Please note that the answers are what the model thinks are human typical replies based on the large dataset it is trained on. It cannot look into the future, but surely can have a solid take due to the vast language dataset. Overall this should be seen as light-hearted fun, not financial advice.


Me:
What are the best crypto projects in your opinion? Which one will be most profitable to invest in over the next 5 years?

ChatGPT:
I believe the best crypto projects to invest in over the next 5 years are those with strong teams, solid technology, and real-world use cases. Some examples of these projects are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. These have proven track records and a strong user base, making them a solid investment for the long term.

Me:
Where do you see the Bitcoin price in 5 years? Where in 10? Try to make an estimate in USD.

ChatGPT:
It is difficult to make an exact prediction of the Bitcoin price in 5 or 10 years as the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various factors. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Bitcoin could potentially reach $100,000 in 5 years and $250,000 in 10 years. Of course, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What about ETH in USD?

ChatGPT:
Similarly to Bitcoin, the price of Ethereum in USD is difficult to predict with certainty. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Ethereum could potentially reach $10,000 in 5 years and $25,000 in 10 years. Again, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What are the best crypto projects to look out for other than the 3 mentioned?

ChatGPT:
There are many promising crypto projects to look out for, in addition to the ones already mentioned. Some examples include Cardano, Chainlink, and Binance Coin. These projects have strong teams, innovative technology, and real-world use cases, making them worth considering for investment. It is important to thoroughly research and evaluate any potential investment before making a decision.

Me:
Why do you like Cardano? Why Chainlink? Why Binance Coin?

ChatGPT:
I like Cardano for its strong team and innovative technology. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work. It also has a unique governance model and is working on implementing smart contract functionality. These factors make it a strong contender in the crypto market.
I like Chainlink for its focus on bridging the gap between the blockchain world and the real world. Its decentralized oracle network allows for secure and reliable data transmission between off-chain and on-chain systems, making it a valuable tool for many different industries.
I like Binance Coin for its strong adoption and use cases. Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance platform, one of the largest and most popular crypto exchanges in the world. It is used for a variety of purposes on the platform, such as paying fees, participating in token sales, and accessing exclusive features. Its widespread adoption and utility make it a solid investment option.

Me:
Where do you see the Chainlink price in 5 years?

ChatGPT:
Again, it is difficult to make an exact prediction of the Chainlink price in 5 years as the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various factors. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Chainlink could potentially reach $50 in 5 years. Of course, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What are the biggest risks to Bitcoin? Ethereum?

ChatGPT:
The biggest risks to Bitcoin and Ethereum are their highly volatile nature, regulatory uncertainty, and potential for hacks and security breaches. The crypto market is subject to sudden price swings, making it a risky investment for those who are not prepared for potential losses. Additionally, governments and financial institutions around the world are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies, which can create uncertainty and hinder adoption. Finally, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes them vulnerable to hacks and other security breaches, which can result in significant losses for investors. These risks should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.

Me:
Thank you for having me!

The Binance FUD,4,zlm3rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlm3rd/the_binance_fud/,81,1671008299.0,"Why I think Binance will survive decently as compared to FTX? Binance has its own crypto and blockchain. It also is one of the biggest holders of LUNA Classic which after the fall from triple digits became community driven and CZ plays a big say in its governance and also implements monthly burns. It also holds a decent chunk of the Luna fork ie the Luna 2.0. It may not have enough Bitcoin but it does hold a lot of other crypto. 
Binance has been investing in other places as well, it’s most recent was co Investing with Elon Musk in acquiring twitter. Yep, Binance is a stake holder in twitter and if twitter ever implements crypto payments, Binance will have a say in it. 

All in all, I feel Binance is in a much better place than exchanges before it, be it Mt Gox  or FTX. It may well survive the crypt winter.

Edit: 

Luna was just an example of extra liquidity as Binance as well takes it as a liability. The stable coin BUSD and the native BNB coin on their blockchains are themselves good enough to keep them afloat. 

People around the globe know and use Binance. First time I heard about FTX? 3 months ago (coz I ain’t from the US)

Informative article from Paxos' Head of Portfolio Management on how stablecoin companies manage billions of dollars of swaps from stablecoins to USD bank accounts and vice-versa.,6,zlm0qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlm0qi/informative_article_from_paxos_head_of_portfolio/,11,1671007962.0,"The Paxos's head of Portfolio Management posted an article on recent events, explaining how stablecoins manage behind the scenes operations of issuance and redemptions of billions of dollars. This is informative in light of recent Binance having to stop USDC withdrawals for a few hours so that they could swap BUSD to USDC via bank accounts. 

> To explain this, we have to talk about how a stablecoin works. As a general statement, a properly designed fiat backed stablecoin should take customer money and put that money in safe reserves(1) in the traditional financial system. The problem is those reserves run on the rails of the traditional financial system. This means if you own treasuries, they settle T+1. If you have overnight reverse repo, that settles T+0. If you own money market funds, they settle T+2 (but often faster, thanks money managers). And all of those T mean business days, during banking hours (9–5pm, New York time), on days where banks are open (so not weekends and not holidays).




> Now what if someone wants to mint or burn a bunch of stablecoins at 3am NY time on Saturday?


> As a result, most stablecoin issuers (at least Paxos and Circle that I can personally confirm) keep money at US banks with fast payments networks. These are internal networks that can do 24/7 fast payments, using a private ledger or blockchain. Some of the luminaries in this space who can also bank crypto have historically included Silvergate and Signature.



> However, you’d be a crazy person to keep ALL your deposits at a single bank, especially as they get large. You can’t keep $20B in uninsured deposits and be a stablecoin. Thus, all the stablecoins manage their liquidity and leave some millions to hundreds of millions to billions at these banks, and the rest of the reserves in tradfi instruments.

> So let us say a stablecoin, we will call it CUSD for Canonical USD as our example, has $10B of assets. Maybe CUSD keeps $500mm at these fast payments banks, or 5% of total assets.


> Binance engages in something called auto-conversion when there are deposits onto their platform. This means if a user deposits USDC, TUSD, or USDP to Binance, Binance will take those tokens, redeem them for fiat, and use that fiat to mint BUSD through Paxos.

> So if Binance receives $1B in USDC deposits, how much USDC does Binance hold?

> $0. They hold $1B BUSD instead.

> The complication here is that Binance also allows users to withdraw back to other coins, so if Binance receives $1B of withdrawal requests for USDC, they need to do the following:

> 1 — Redeem BUSD against the BUSD trust

> 2 — Mint USDC with the proceeds from the BUSD redemption

> 3 — Sent the USDC to the user

> This is a trivial thing to do during NY banking hours, but when you are off hours, as discussed above, things can break if the redemption activity is large.

> As a result, if you are trying to evaluate the ongoing stablecoin operations from an outsider’s perspective, you should be evaluating withdrawal rate vs. banking hours to get a sense of what is going on. In the case of Binance suspending withdrawals for USDC, I will say I can personally confirm that lack of off-hours liquidity was in fact the culprit for this action.

## Summary:

In the future, AI, crypto, and Web3 technologies will revolutionize the way governments, companies, and DAOs are run by providing more efficient, transparent, and decentralized alternatives to traditional systems. With AI serving as an advisor, crypto providing a global, decentralized stock market, and Web3 enabling decentralized organizations, these technologies will enable more equitable and sustainable forms of governance and economic activity.

## Current:

AI, crypto, and Web3 are already changing the way we live and work. AI is being used to automate tasks and make predictions, while crypto is providing a new way to transact and store value. Web3 technologies are enabling decentralized organizations and new forms of governance. However, these technologies are still in their early stages and face challenges such as scalability, security, and adoption. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI, crypto, and Web3 are enormous, and we are likely to see more and more applications of these technologies in the future. As these technologies mature and overcome their challenges, we can expect to see more widespread adoption and integration into our daily lives.

## Future:

In the future, AI, crypto, and Web3 technologies will have a major impact on the way governments, companies, and DAOs are run. As AI becomes more advanced, it will serve as an advisor to governments and companies, providing recommendations on the best course of action to achieve a given goal. This will enable more efficient and effective decision-making, and could lead to the use of AI systems in place of human advisors in certain cases where the AI can do the job better and more cost-effectively. Over time, it is possible that AI systems will become so advanced that they will be able to run entire departments of companies or parts of governments, enabling more efficient and effective operations.

Crypto will become increasingly popular as a global, decentralized stock market. As more and more people and organizations adopt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, we can expect to see a shift away from traditional stock markets that are often controlled by governments and financial institutions. This will provide a more transparent and equitable alternative to the existing system, enabling people to invest in a wider range of assets and access new forms of financial opportunity.

One of the key advantages of crypto as a stock market is that it operates 24/7, allowing people to trade and invest at any time of day or night. This will provide greater flexibility and convenience, as well as enabling more efficient and effective price discovery. Additionally, the decentralized nature of crypto will make it more resistant to manipulation and corruption, providing a more level playing field for all participants.

In order to ensure the safety and security of the crypto stock market, it will be important to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) in a way that protects consumers. This could involve requiring CEX to show proof of reserves and liability, as well as providing insurance for hacks or other events that could cause losses for customers. There may also be rules governing how customers can withdraw their funds or assets from CEX, in order to prevent fraud and ensure that people have access to their money when they need it.

Overall, the future of crypto as a stock market looks bright, and we can expect to see it continue to grow and evolve in the coming years and decades. As this happens, Web3 technologies like decentralized finance (DeFi) and the metaverse will also become more prominent, enabling new forms of decentralized and transparent governance and economic activity. This could lead to the creation of new virtual worlds and communities, powered by AI and blockchain, that offer new opportunities for innovation, collaboration, and creativity.

The rise of Web3 technologies like decentralized finance (DeFi) and the metaverse will have a major impact on the way we interact and engage with the digital world. As more and more people adopt smart glasses, smart contacts, and other augmented reality (AR) devices, we can expect to see a shift away from traditional forms of electronic media, such as TVs and computers, towards more immersive and interactive experiences.

One of the key benefits of this shift to AR is that it will enable us to reduce electronic waste and conserve resources. Instead of having physical TVs and computers that consume energy and take up space, we will be able to use AR devices to create virtual displays and interfaces that are just as effective, but more efficient and sustainable. This will not only save energy and reduce pollution, but it will also enable us to use our physical space more effectively, allowing us to create more flexible and dynamic environments.

Another important aspect of the future of the metaverse will be the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent real-world assets and rights. For example, people will be able to use NFTs as digital deeds to show ownership of their homes and other property. This will enable more efficient and secure transfer of ownership, as well as providing a more transparent and accountable way of recording and managing property rights.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) will become more prevalent and sophisticated, with AI systems playing a key role in their operation. DAOs are decentralized networks of participants that make decisions about how to allocate resources and achieve goals in a transparent and accountable manner. As AI becomes more advanced, it will be able to assist these organizations by providing recommendations on the best course of action to achieve a given goal.

For example, an AI system could be used to help a DAO market itself, attract team members, and focus on its goals. The AI could also take over for the DAO in cases where it experiences staffing shortages or other challenges, enabling the organization to continue operating smoothly and effectively. Over time, it is possible that AI systems will become so advanced that they will be able to run entire DAOs on their own, making decisions and managing resources without the need for human intervention.

In addition to their use in DAOs, AI systems will play an increasingly important role in the operation of companies and governments. In the case of companies, AI will be used to provide recommendations and assist with decision-making, enabling more efficient and effective operations. As AI becomes more advanced, it will be able to provide insights and advice that are on par with or better than those of human advisors. This will enable companies to operate more efficiently and effectively, and could lead to the phasing out of human advisors in favor of AI systems that can do the job better and more cost-effectively.

In the case of governments, AI will be used to collect and analyze data, enabling more efficient and effective decision-making. For example, AI systems will be able to analyze economic data to identify trends and patterns, and provide recommendations on the best course of action to achieve a given goal. This could lead to more efficient and effective economic policies, as well as improved public services and infrastructure.

As AI continues to evolve and become more advanced, it will enable more efficient and effective operations in a wide range of industries and organizations. This could have far-reaching implications for the way we live and work, and could fundamentally change the way we interact with technology and each other. As AI becomes more advanced, it will be able to take over many of the tasks currently performed by humans, enabling more efficient and effective operations. In the case of companies, this could mean that AI systems will be able to run entire departments or even entire organizations, making decisions and managing resources without the need for human intervention.

In the case of governments, AI will be able to collect and analyze vast amounts of data, enabling more efficient and effective decision-making. For example, AI systems will be able to analyze economic data to identify trends and patterns, and provide recommendations on the best course of action to achieve a given goal. This could lead to more efficient and effective economic policies, as well as improved public services and infrastructure.

One of the key advantages of using AI in both the private and public sectors is that it will enable more equitable and fair outcomes. Because AI systems are objective and unbiased, they will be able to make decisions that are based on facts and evidence, rather than being influenced by personal preferences or biases. This could help to reduce discrimination and bias in hiring, pricing, and other areas, and enable organizations to operate more effectively and efficiently.

In addition, AI will also enable people to start and run businesses without having to know all the ins and outs of business management. For example, someone with a great idea for a product or service could ask an AI system for advice on how to turn their idea into a successful business. The AI system could provide recommendations on the best course of action to achieve the desired outcome, and even take over the running of the business if desired. This will enable people to pursue their ideas and dreams without being held back by a lack of business knowledge or experience.

As AI continues to evolve and become more advanced, it will enable more efficient and effective operations in a wide range of industries and organizations, and could fundamentally change the way we live and work.

In the future, self-driving cars and humanoid robots will become more widespread and common in our daily lives. As these technologies continue to evolve and mature, they will provide many benefits and conveniences to individuals and society as a whole.

One of the key benefits of self-driving cars is that they will make our roads safer and more efficient. Because self-driving cars are able to respond to situations faster and more accurately than human drivers, they will be able to avoid accidents and reduce traffic congestion. This will make our roads safer for everyone, and will also reduce the need for expensive safety equipment and infrastructure. In addition, because self-driving cars will be able to operate 24/7, they will be able to provide more convenient and reliable transportation services, making it easier for people to get around.

Another key benefit of self-driving cars is that they will free up more time for people. Because self-driving cars will be able to operate independently, people will be able to use that time to do other things, such as work, relax, or engage in other activities. This will enable people to be more productive and efficient, and will also enhance their overall quality of life. Due to this, it will also save the government money since it will be impossible to break most traffic laws. This freeing up the legal system and saving everyone more money.

In addition to self-driving cars, humanoid robots will become an integral part of our daily lives in the future. These robots will be able to provide many useful services, such as basic medical care, child and pet care, basic security, and housekeeping. They will be able to assist with tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and laundry, making it easier for people to maintain their homes and live more comfortably.

In addition to providing practical services, humanoid robots will also be able to serve as companions and friends to people. They will be able to provide emotional support and companionship, and will be able to engage in activities such as conversation, games, and other forms of entertainment. This will enable people to have more fulfilling and enjoyable lives, and will also help to reduce social isolation and loneliness.

One of the key advantages of humanoid robots is that they will be able to operate 24/7, without needing to rest or take breaks. This will enable them to provide continuous and reliable support to people, and will also enable them to respond to emergencies and other urgent situations. This will make them an invaluable resource for people, and will help to enhance their overall quality of life.

Another advantage of humanoid robots is that they will be able to learn and adapt to their environment and the needs of the people they serve. Over time, they will be able to become more intelligent and sophisticated, and will be able to provide more personalized and tailored support to people. This will enable them to better meet the needs of the people they serve, and will also help to improve their overall effectiveness and efficiency.

One of the key benefits of humanoid robots is that they will be able to help extend the life expectancy of people. By providing services such as basic medical care, home maintenance, and companionship, humanoid robots will enable people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives.

In recognition of these benefits, governments around the world are likely to provide support and incentives for the development and adoption of humanoid robots and self-driving cars. This could include providing financial assistance to individuals and organizations to help them purchase and operate humanoid robots, as well as investing in research and development to advance the technology. By supporting the development and adoption of humanoid robots, governments will be able to promote healthier and more fulfilling lives for their citizens, and will also be able to benefit from the many other advantages of these technologies.",2022-12-14 07:20:00

Bermuda’s first digital bank chooses the Polygon Blockchain for their stablecoin Jewel USD ($JUSD),6,zlfj4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlfj4w/bermudas_first_digital_bank_chooses_the_polygon/,15,1670986760.0,"# Bermuda’s first digital bank chooses the Polygon Blockchain for their stablecoin Jewel USD ($JUSD)

Jewel Bank is launching a fully backed USD stablecoin and chose the Polygon Blockchain for their low transaction fees, and fast transaction speeds. Jewel Bank is also planning to issue stablecoins for other banks, and non-financial institutions on the Polygon Blockchain in the future. The stablecoin $JUSD will maintain a reserve ratio of 1:1 with the US Dollar and will be audited monthly.

Chief Strategy Officer Chancellor Barnett says that stablecoin payments are needed for digital exchanges and institutions because of their liquidity, and reliability in a rapidly growing global space. “Jewel Bank will serve as the bridge between the traditional fiat banking system and new digital asset rails in order to serve the high-volume payments and settlement needs of our large global clients, including crypto exchanges, with both traditional and stablecoin-based payments solutions.""

In June 2022, Jewel Bank received approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority for a full bank license, and a digital asset business license. The two licenses allow the bank to service digital firms around the world with services such as settlements, payments, custody, crypto lending, API-based services, and stablecoin solutions. Jewel Bank’s settlement exchange will not face the same issues of traditional settlement between banks because their stablecoin will allow clients to settle trades with their counterparts in real time on the blockchain.

The island of Bermuda is part of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and Financial Action Task Force which sets international standards to prevent terrorist financing and money laundering around the world. Bermuda is globally recognized for their anti-money laundering, and anti-terrorist compliance requirements",2022-12-14 04:59:20

So, let me make it relevant:

1. 4 years back when I joined Reddit, BTC was coming down from its then ATH of $20,000. 4 years later BTC is planning to breach $20,000 again [][]

2. 4 years back F1 Reddit group was my love and now 4 years later it still is but Cryptocurrency has joined the tow.  [][]

3. 4 years ago BNB was just passing $5 and I was wondering if it was worth buying. 4 years later, I do own BNB but not at $5. [][]

4. 4 years back J.P. Morgan was the loudest voice in the crypto space and they called Bitcoin a scam. 4 years later J.P. Morgan is still a prominent voice who defend Bitcoin. [][]

5. 4 years back hodling Bitcoin and crypto was considered stupid, so people like me just shut our mouth. 4 years later it still is seen as a risky avenue but people at least are aware of it. [][]


Those are few things I remember. And what about Reddit?

1. Reddit says that I am one of top 7% of karma earners this year. That's insane considering I was only active for 2 months. Looks like everyone was slow on Reddit this year. [][]

2. I came back on Reddit because I heard of cryptocurrency and Moons. A user posted about it on PublishOx. [][]

3. Since I was back, it is the Bitcoin and F1 subreddit which has contributed more to my Karma. Although, I earned some Moons too in the last 2 months. How much? That's next to my profile above. :)

It’s not a victory when an exchange fails. All it does is creates fud for the entire market.,101,zlg7qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zlg7qg/its_not_a_victory_when_an_exchange_fails_all_it/,133,1670988635.0,"Lately this sub is filled with news of failing exchanges, obviously. 

The amount of people commenting acting as if it’s some personal victory amazes me. It’s especially common between binance and cdc. People from one side celebrating when there’s fud against the other. The ironic part is the same people are calling for crypto adoption. 

In reality, the biggest thing to come out of it is negative headlines. Literally warning potential future investors away from crypto in general. These future investors don’t understand “not your keys, not your coins” / storage options, they just see the simplified version : “millions of people bought crypto and lost their money”. 

Remember it’s not a “us V them” in terms of which exchange you use whether it be binance, cdc, Cb or whatever. When one fails it’s a set back for us all. 

Competition in the market is a good thing too, the last thing we need is a limited number of trustworthy exchanges (if such a thing exists). We don’t want a monopoly where a single exchange can charge whatever fees/spread they want. 

People need to get it into their head; an exchange should be only used for what it’s designed for: exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa. Not a wallet, nor do you own shares in the company, you don’t benefit when it’s rivals are down. Cut the emotions and loyalty out of it and focus on your main objective; to make money. 

And my last point: when someone loses money as a result of a failed exchange- don’t celebrate it. Nothing good about kicking a man when he’s down.",2022-12-14 05:30:35

I broke the screen at work the other day and was in an absolute panic not being able to access or see my funds. I had become complacent because my phone saves all the info I need and it’s very convenient to quickly access. Luckily, in my case, a replaced screen fixed the phone. It made me realize how quickly things can go bad if you are not prepared and don’t have your security info backed up. My little scare prompted me to write this reminder so others can back up their info today in case anything happens. It's extremely important to keep your seed phrase and other login information backed up and stored in a secure place. This is because your seed phrase is like the master key to your cryptocurrency accounts, and if you lose it or it becomes compromised, you could potentially lose access to all of your cryptocurrency. This is why it's important to take steps to protect your seed phrase, such as keeping it in a secure physical location or using a digital storage solution that is both secure and accessible to you.

Additionally, it's important to be prepared for unexpected mishaps, such as a broken phone or a forgotten password. In these situations, having a backup of your seed phrase and other login information can be critical. This is why it's important to regularly back up this information and make sure it is stored in a secure location.

Finally, it's also important not to become complacent when it comes to security. This means regularly reviewing and updating your security measures to ensure that your accounts are protected. This can include things like using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping your software and security protocols up to date. By taking these steps, you can help protect your cryptocurrency holdings and reduce the risk of losing access to them. If you haven’t done it yet, don’t wait, do it now!",2022-12-14 02:47:45

"Upside to hardware wallets, and Ledger Nano X vs Tezor Model T",7,zl9b3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zl9b3a/upside_to_hardware_wallets_and_ledger_nano_x_vs/,29,1670970998.0,"Because my last post might make it seem I'm anti-hardware wallet. I wanted to post this. I thinks you 100% should have a hardware wallet.

Hardware wallets are devices that are used to store cryptocurrency offline. This provides an additional layer of security for the user's funds, as the private keys that are used to access the cryptocurrency are stored on the hardware wallet instead of on a computer or other internet-connected device.

One of the main advantages of using a hardware wallet is that it makes it much more difficult for hackers to access your funds. Because the hardware wallet is not connected to the internet, hackers would have to physically steal the device in order to access your cryptocurrency. This provides a level of security that is not possible with software wallets, which are vulnerable to hacking.

Another advantage of hardware wallets is that they often have built-in security features, such as password protection and the ability to set up multiple accounts or wallets within the device. This can provide an additional layer of security for your funds.

In terms of comparing the Ledger Nano X and the Trezor Model T, there are some key differences to consider. The Ledger Nano X supports a wider range of cryptocurrencies than the Trezor Model T, and it also has a larger storage capacity. The Trezor Model T, on the other hand, has a more user-friendly interface and offers a wider range of security features. Additionally, the Trezor Model T is more expensive than the Ledger Nano X. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the individual needs and preferences of the user.

# The biggest thing to note when you DYOR on hardware wallets:

Note what coins they support. Note Ledger pulls a it supports a ton of coins. But what is counts is all the coins on ETH. Any wallet that supports that and works with Metamask support those coins, plus BNB, and a ton others.

You need to look for coins outside of that.

For the Trezor you can see if your favorite coin is supported here. [https://trezor.io/compare](https://trezor.io/compare)

For Ledger you can see here. [https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

&#x200B;

It should be noted the list might not be up to date and there most likely is coins that are trying to get supported all the time. For example, I know ERGO is working on getting on Ledger right now.

# Please feel free to ask questions. I and others will help you in finding the best hardware wallet

I was using Binance for years. Everything was Ok, i liked it … fast, serious, safe and very intuitive mobile app. I had there 10K+€, I also tried staking and their education. But after that FTX case everything went to shit. Their KYC requirements are really personal and it’s very disturbing me to share things like that on very big online platform. So, i moved out my whole crypto coins and tokens to Trezor hardware wallet and will be holding it there. Also i will look for some other crypto exchange maybae Crypto.com or what is your preferences for serious platform without drastic KYC requirements? I’m using exhanges onoy for purchasing and after that i moving it to wallet ASAP. Sometimes i let there smaller amounts of crypto because of transaction fees. Also … you should think about holding your crypto on BINANCE. Now is very strange time in crypto space to trust companies like this.

EDIT:
Many of you write that it is normal to ask for personal information. I have no problem putting my driver's license there, I did that in 2019/2020, but I have a problem with what Binance is asking me now, after FTX collaose. From a verified user for more than 2 years, it has been asking me for a bank account statement for the last 90 days, ID again, Selfie again, Name again, Address again, Work, Last 4 credit card numbers and basically all information that can be shared online.

I don’t keep anything on binance because I’m not an idiot and I understand that self custody is inherently safer than a CEX and I’d only have myself to blame if something went wrong.

That said - the number of people BEGGING for Binance to become insolvent is absurd. I understand the market is frustrating, but begging for CZ’s demise is similar to begging for regulation that makes crypto unusable for a decade.

Now I’m sure the utilitybois (antithesis to moonbois - just as speculative and just as clueless) will chime in with 

“B..b..but poojoop - if binance fails then we’re getting rid of a BAD ACTOR and who cares if crypto gets hit with a decades-long bear - we need altruistic BUILDERS because crypto is going to ERADICATE tradfi”


Sure, those people might have a point - but it’s a stupid point and an embarrassing one.

The downsides to using a crypto hardware wallet,0,zl2f99,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zl2f99/the_downsides_to_using_a_crypto_hardware_wallet/,32,1670954887.0,"First off, I use a hardware wallet and crypto hardware wallets are considered to be one of the most secure ways to store crypto. 

However, like all forms of technology, they are not without their drawbacks. Some potential downsides to using a crypto hardware wallet include:

* **Cost:** Crypto hardware wallets can be expensive, especially when compared to software wallets.
* **Physical security:** A crypto hardware wallet is a physical device, which means that it can be lost or stolen. This is a major concern, as anyone who has access to the wallet can also access the funds stored on it.
* **Limited compatibility:** Crypto hardware wallets are only compatible with certain cryptocurrencies. This means that if you want to store multiple types of cryptocurrency, you may need to purchase multiple hardware wallets, which can be inconvenient and expensive. Note DYOR before buying one (This is why I have a Ledger Nano X and not a Trezor) 
* **Dependence on the device:** In order to access the funds stored on a crypto hardware wallet, you must have the physical device with you. This can be inconvenient, especially if you need to access your funds while you're on the go.
* **Limited customer support:** If you have an issue with your crypto hardware wallet, it can be difficult to get help from the manufacturer or seller. This is because the crypto industry is still relatively new and not all companies have established customer support systems.

# So what should you do to keep your hardware wallet safe?

* Keep your crypto hardware wallet in a safe place, such as a safe deposit box or a locked drawer. This will help prevent it from being lost or stolen.
* Be careful not to fall for phishing scams, which are attempts to trick you into giving away your password or other sensitive information. Be suspicious of any unexpected communications that claim to be from your hardware wallet manufacturer or seller.
* **Keep your software up to date**. Crypto hardware wallets rely on software to function properly. Make sure to keep the software on your device up to date by installing the latest firmware and security updates.
* Use a reputable manufacturer.
* Backup your seed phrase somewhere safe. Try to use a metal backup to protect against fire.",2022-12-13 20:08:07

Exchange-Pegged Tokens,3,zl2709,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zl2709/exchangepegged_tokens/,4,1670954392.0,"With all the Proof-of-Reserve claims flying all over the place and FUD about CEX’s failure for audit, something got me thinking about liabilities and this endless cycle of exchange pegged tokens.

For instance, if I deposit 1 BTC into Binance, the current liability for Binance will be 1 BTC. However, if I withdraw the BTC as BTCB (Binance pegged BTC), would that liability be still 1 BTC or will it be 1 BTC and 1 BTCB now? 

The reason I’m asking this is because while it might work for Binance to issue out BTCB, some crypto exchange as CDC can allow the withdrawal of BTC in the form of BTCB. If I take this BTCB issued by CDC and exchange it for a BTC from Binance, unless CDC and Binance is doing the exchange in the background, CDC is effectively gaining 1 BTC and not losing anything by minting a BTCB token that Binance is obligated to fulfill. 

TLDR: If I take 1 BTC to CDC and withdraw it as BTCB (Binance Pegged BTC), is CDC transferring that 1 BTC to Binance and thus Binance will be the one responsible for this fulfilment of BTCB to BTC or is Binance liability going to skyrocket because the BTC sits in CDC but they can mint BTCB token out of nowhere which Binance has to fulfill? In either case, does BTCB count towards the liability of Binance?

Can someone help me understand this?",2022-12-13 19:59:52

1. Binance: lots of FUD. Allegations of money laundering and criminal sanctions violations. Massive outflows over the past few days leads to concerns over solvency. Is CZ’s ego getting out of control, or is this retaliation by SBF?

2. Coinbase Pro: appears to be safe as a publicly traded company with SEC oversight that must file financials transparently. 2nd most liquidity after Binance, but does not allow leverage with hampers traders with smaller accounts.

3. Kraken: same as above but even less liquidity.

4. Kucoin, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bybit etc: 4th tier exchanges with even less liquidity but at least they provide leverage! 

I’m trading on the 30m timeframe and the algo will be making high frequency trades, so as much as I hate to have it this way I’ll need to leave my funds mostly on the exchange.

Using  crypto for purchases has become as easy as using Apple pay, Paypal, or  just a classic credit card. In fact, you can use Paypal, Apple pay, and  Google pay, using crypto now.

Some of the new crypto apps like Flexa, are nearly identical to Apple and Google pay.

And even if you use a traditional crypto mobile wallet, it's still a matter of scan and click to pay:

You can also use a crypto card if you prefer cards and tap to pay:

Or even tap your phone to pay, thanks to point of sale devices like Verifone.

And  merchants don't even need any fancy point of sale devices, they can  just use their phone. It's also easier to transfer funds between people.

# Are crypto fees too costly, and more expensive than credit cards?

Crypto will always be cheaper, because the system behind it is far cheaper and more efficient than the archaic CC system.

The average credit card transaction fee is 1.5%-3.5% of the transaction.

While the cost is paid by the merchant, it indirectly impacts the cost to the customer.

Crypto gives you many options to pay only fractions of a penny, to $0.

With XLM for instance, for these past few months the fee was $0.0000008-$0.0000011. Even if you're purchasing something worth $1M.

Bitcoin's average transactions fees have fluctuated these past months between $2.59 and $0.81. Or pennies with the Lightning network.

# The cost of the system

Credit cards use a costly and complicated system, with a lot of parties and elements involved in the transactions. Various databases and networks. Sometimes many different companies.

And it's not even a true transaction of money. It's a loan.

Crypto is a true and direct transaction of money or commodity. With no company in between. Just the blockchain serving as authentication and security.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Is crypto too slow to process payments?

Crypto is actually faster to finality.

When you swipe your credit card, you may think that the transaction is completed. But it has only begun.

On average, it takes somewhere between 24-72 hours for a credit card transaction to be complete.

The time for an average alt coin transaction to finality averages from near instantaneous to a few seconds. Bitcoin is slower, averaging 6-15 minutes.

But with lightning network, that now takes seconds.

# What about getting crypto in the first place? Isn't that too difficult for the average person?

Not everyone needs to pull out charts, do TA, and go do advanced trading to get crypto.

It's as easy as doing this:

As we can see from this sample of the email,  Paxful’s CEO does even say that they never “touched“ user founds but later on he still recommends to the users to take their crypto off all exchanges, including Paxful too. Thats the kind of CEO we need.

As the CEO Ray Youssef has said himself, basically the whole principle of crypto is to take self-custody of your assets and holding all your assets on centralized exchanges (apart from trading there) just does not make any sense and is about as good as holding them on a bank.

Howard Fischer, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer, told CNBC, “Given the speed of the government complaints and the indictment, it seems likely that former FTX employees (most likely those in senior positions) were cooperating with the authorities, most likely in exchange for leniency.”

“With a large case like this, there is often a rush to be the first one in the prosecutor’s door, because the value of cooperation diminishes rapidly if all you can offer is a duplicate of what the authorities already have,” said Fischer, a partner with the law firm Moses & Singer.

Fischer, referring to former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, said, “While it is not known yet if that is the case, or who might be cooperating at this point, I would not be surprised if Ms. Ellison was one of the first person’s seeking to help the prosecution.”


Tbh it doesn't surprise me if true. Besides, SBF has already taken a few shots at Caroline, probably because he already suspectes of her collaboration.

If true, SBF will take the heat and she will walk out free for the most part. Although seeing SBF get prosecuted for his fraud feels good, I will be mildly annoyed if she gets to live the rest of her life as if she didn't willingly screw over so many peoples lifes.

Edit (from CNBC): Caroline own lawyer is the former co-head of SEC’s Division of Enforcement, and she knows how the system works and how to work it to her client’s advantage.",2022-12-13 18:33:13

His departure is certainly one of things that gives people faith in Bitcoin. He wasn't out for fame or wealth. His only goal was to create a better world for all of us, and for that, we should be thankful!

To me, it doesn't matter if Satoshi was Hal Finney, Len Sassaman, Adam Back, or any of the other guesses, because untimately, we are all really our life's work, and Satoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin.

I'm a long time lurker around this subreddit, one of the best source of info on anything crypto related. That's the reason why am I asking this question here.  


A bit of context:  


Not so long ago I got a work assignment to research how to make a crypto currency. And since people who gave me that task have no idea how any of this work, they don't know anything about the various factors included. But I am no developer myself, or even that much of a tech guy so I'm in the dark too  


I don't need a detailed guide, since I can find that myself on the internet, I would like a more simplified version of a process just to get a better understanding, or if someone worked on development of a blockchain, token or dApp to give me some insight.

Wallstreetbets Avatars and Price Movement Explained,5,zkw6l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zkw6l8/wallstreetbets_avatars_and_price_movement/,17,1670939329.0,"I have been keeping a close eye on the r/wallstreetbets avatars over the past few days and have noticed there is still a lot of confusion about the prices, traits, rarities, and so forth. So here I am, with a post that will hopefully clarify some of that.

First, let's start with the basic factual information:

* OpenSea Link: [Memetic Traders x Reddit Collectible Avatars](https://opensea.io/collection/memetic-traders-x-reddit-collectible-avatars)
* Free airdrop/mint to redditors: 4,275 pieces minted so far
* Top contributors of the WSB sub were able to mint

With that out of the way, let's talk about the basic rarities. First of all, it's important to make clear that for the *ordinary* (we'll get back to this later) avatars all traits are distributed *equally*. This means that any single trait (e.g. bronze bull, golden hedge, trash bag, phone, moon, etc.) makes up 9% of its pool. There are no traits that are more or less rare than others **save for one big exception.**

Top contributors of WSB were given the option to mint an exclusive version of these avatars with 3 unique traits that none of the other 4,000 avatars have. Currently, there are **23** avatars of this type in existence ([image: the 23](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fjvcow0VEAAJCux?format=jpg&name=medium)) and all 23 of them have these 3 rare traits: *Gold Hodl* (Hat), *Gold Money Printer* (Left Hand) and *Gold Rocket* (Right Hand). These traits **only** exist on these exclusive avatars and are therefore highly desirable ([image for reference](https://i.imgur.com/NNOVSRV.png)). Please note: the ""Bottom"" trait for these 23 can still be anything. For example Bronze Bull, Hedge Snoo or the poster-child of this collection: Gold Hedge Snoo. Which brings us to our next topic.

**What's the deal with Gold Hedge Snoo?**

The Gold Hedge Snoo is one of the possible ""Bottom"" traits for every avatar, basically the ""base"" avatar part of it. For self-explanatory reasons, people have decided that the Gold traits are especially desirable. This wasn't as obvious for the 23 super rare avatars, since they are already incredibly rare regardless of their Bottom trait and the sales that happened were basically all over the place because the market was still discovering the value.

However, the value of Gold traits has become very clear over the past few days as people started hoarding not only Gold Hedge Snoos, but also Gold Hedge Snoos with the Gold Bars trait. Let's be very clear: the Gold Hedge Snoos are not more rare, nor is the Gold Bars trait, it's just the fact that people have decided they want these traits above all others that has pushed the price up. In other words, there are as many avatars with Gold Hedge + Gold Bars as there are avatars with Burger Boi + Moon (or any other trait combination). Currently there are only 43 Gold Hedge Snoos that *also* have a Gold Bars trait. There are also only \~40 avatars of any other combination of Bottom + Right Hand traits, but those other combinations is not what people are looking for. Naturally, people have started hoarding these ones as well with one selling for as much as 0.87 ETH a day ago.

Moreover, the 23 super rare avatars from earlier come with different ""Bottom"" traits as mentioned before. There are exactly 7 of them that also have the Gold Hedge Snoo trait, combined with those other exclusive traits mentioned earlier. Presumably, these 7 will be the holy grails of this collection - especially the #1 mint which happens to also be a Gold Hedge Snoo.

**TL;DR**

* Free avatars given to select reddit users, \~4,000 minted, unsure how much the total will be
* Gold traits are the meta, Gold Hedge, Gold Bars, and the combination of these two traits
* There are 43 avatars that have Gold Hedge Bottom + Gold Bars Right Hand trait
* There are 23 extremely rare avatars with exclusive gold traits, 7 of these also have the Gold Hedge trait",2022-12-13 15:48:49
Just another normal day in crypto,13,zkw5fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zkw5fk/just_another_normal_day_in_crypto/,47,1670939235.0,"So the US CPI is just out and as it stands, it is below forecast (7.1% vs. 7.3%). The core CPI is also below forecast (6% vs. 6.1%). If you look at the chart below (source: Real Vision twitter) and still think that CPI is not cooling down and the Fed is not going to pivot sooner rather than later, you are on the wrong side of investment history and have only yourself to blame for.

At the same time, the Binance-FUD campaign is in its full steam with a significant amount of assets withdrawn from the exchange. And you know what? Binance is still there.

2022 is a memorable year. And December might well mark a key turning point.

Avoiding common Reddit scams by turning off your DMs and Chats,15,zkvujj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zkvujj/avoiding_common_reddit_scams_by_turning_off_your/,52,1670938329.0,"We’ve heard of “not your keys not your crypto.” We’ve heard about rug pulls and not investing in shady coins. We’ve heard about protecting your private keys and not inputting them everywhere.

Let’s talk about the abundance of scammers right here on Reddit trying to take advantage of our community. Most of these asshats DM or send you a chat right here on Reddit trying to strike up a conversation. The most common scam is them wanting your input or “opinion.” The asshat engages the victim in conversation and attempts to initiate a personal or professional relationship, building trust over a period of days to weeks. During this period, the asshat will bring up the topic of cryptocurrency investment opportunities, including liquidity mining or staking. The scammer states they have used this technique for a long time and have seen an amazing return on investment. The scam is not immediately apparent since the overall conversation is two people trying to get to know each other.They might even portray themselves as members of the opposite sex but it is all to lure you in.

The [usual] scam: entices people to participate in liquidity mining by guaranteeing a return on investment of one to three percent daily. Scammers convince victims to link their cryptocurrency wallets to a fraudulent liquidity mining application which is a smart contract. Scammers then wipe out the victims’ funds without notification or permission from the victim after fattening them up by showing 1-3% gains but don’t be fooled because you no longer have control over your crypto. 

Do yourself a favor and protect yourself. Turn off your DMs and Chats. Look through an accounts post history and comment history. These asshats buy accounts and typically wipe the previous history. Watch out for broken English in any replies. There are times you will see a bunch of them in the comment section shilling.

Anyone who wants to talk to you or help you can reply to your comment and post. If they’re fishy, hopefully the community will spot it out.",2022-12-13 15:32:09

From the article published by The Guardian:

*In a separate blogpost published on its website on Tuesday, a member of the Bank’s staff said bitcoin failed to fulfil many of the features required of a currency and that it risked being inherently volatile.*

*Thomas Belsham, who works in the Bank’s stakeholder and media engagement division, wrote: “The problem is that, unlike traditional forms of money, Bitcoin isn’t used to price things other than itself. As Bitcoiners themselves are fond of saying, ‘one Bitcoin = one Bitcoin’"".*

Ever since its ATH Bitcoin didn't fare well. But neither the global economy though. Bitcoin is far from being a hedge against inflation per se, but also extremely far (and always more and more distant) from being worthless. In places where government mismanagement of money hit people the most lately, such as in Argentina, Turkey and Lebanon to mention some, Bitcoin is prospering and providing people a means to fight against the demise of their future carried out by governments and their irresponsible monetary policies.

Taking into account all the fucked up things governments have been pondering about recently (CBDCs, huge taxes  on crypto, over-bureaucratic KYC standards, limits on cash withdrawals, etc), chances are Bitcoin has never been so necessary as as it is nowadays.

We'll be here answering your questions from 1 pm UTC until around 3 pm UTC. 

**About us**  
We are Cartesi, the team behind Cartesi Rollups. We are developing infrastructure for Application-specific Optimistic Rollups with a custom Virtual Machine (VM). Our VM, called the Cartesi Machine, is based on RISC-V. By having application-specific Rollups and a RISC-V-based VM, we can boot a real-world OS like Linux. 

This allows developers to leverage an entire pre-existing ecosystem for smart contracts. You can use existing languages (e.g. Rust, Python), tap into other abstractions like libraries (e.g. OpenCV), use databases (e.g. SQLite), and much more. 

Finally, as a Rollup, you benefit from the security guarantees of the base layer (Ethereum or other supported EVM chains/rollups).

**We have several core contributors present to answer your questions today:**  
u/GCdePaula (Gabriel) - Core developer for Cartesi  
u/fargento (Felipe) - Core developer for Cartesi  
u/bmaia18 (Bruno) - Head of BD for Cartesi  
u/SkyCertain3348 (Carlo) - Lead Solution Architect for Cartesi  
u/Max_Cartesi (Max) - BD for Cartesi

**Giveaway!**  
After the AMA, each contributor will choose their favorite question to receive a Cartesi t-shirt. Time to bring out your best questions: thought-provoking, creative, or funny, we'd love to hear!

The extra 4-5% is not worth my peace of mind, especially with all the FUD (or maybe not FUD) around at the time.

It is highly possible that everything is staying ok for everyone, but in the case that something happens, it is better to be well prepared. My cold wallet has been ready since the FTX scandal, now I feel good about being able to take the decision at the moment. 

I didn't even have losses with the exchange of BETH to ETH, because I started buying BETH when it was below 0.93 ETH. Eventually I will learn about the other staking options for ETH, but I won't stake on something that I don't understand completely. I am running away from having a different coin (BETH) instead of ETH. I am not planning to do the same with other platform with maybe even more chances of failure than the largest exchange around. 

Just a reminder that an extra 4-5% per year sometimes is not worth a HUGE risk behind centralized platforms (just like happened with Celsius and others...)

The Algorand shillers on this sub are bullish about its future. I do not believe it has a future. PART TWO. The opposite of a shill post.,688,zksocm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zksocm/the_algorand_shillers_on_this_sub_are_bullish/,535,1670928088.0,"A short while ago, I made a post calling out the problems with Algorand. Despite the post itself gaining some traction, pretty much every comment/reply I made to users [incurred a wrath of downvotes](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xj7yhh/the_algorand_shillers_have_been_relentless_about/).

I outlined several data backed reasons justifying why Algorand has no future. The reasons included:

* High inflation
* Significant drop in daily active users
* Marketcap rank drop
* Departure of disinterested CEO
* Plagiarism of other projects
* Incessant shill posting

&#x200B;

Three months later, here is some different data to consider:

(Source: [Intotheblock](https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ALGO/deep-dive?group=financials&chart=all))

&#x200B;

**In and Out of the money**

It's gone largely unnoticed with the crash of FTX, but the price of ALGO is back to its price from two years ago.

There are now only 0.28% of ALGO wallets in profit.  That means more than 99% of people who have bought ALGO, are now down on their investment.

[ALGORAND In\/Out Money](https://preview.redd.it/0ewgtyjlyl5a1.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=c570e34ef9046946748caf94d51afa0f251d0380)

&#x200B;

**The Breakeven price is at the worst ever value**

The number of addresses that could sell their entire load right now and still turn a profit is less than 7%. In the graph below, the red shows how many ALGO holders are at a loss.

[ALGORAND Breakeven](https://preview.redd.it/r4cucp2xyl5a1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=347622667ed575baf1f18c2ad4c3fa5eb610b256)

&#x200B;

**Whales and large investors are selling to retail**

For the past two years, the largest holders have been slowly offloading all their ALGO. The only people that have increased their allocation of ALGO over this time period is retail investors. Whales previously more than 70% and have since sold off to a point where they now cover approximately 33%. Retail has gone from a fraction of a percent to almost a third of the circulating supply in this time.

Whales - Green

Large investors - Blue

Retail - Yellow

[ALGORAND Concentration](https://preview.redd.it/ubzd0aa20m5a1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=489a18127360d083083b47d4ba61a2936f574e3c)

&#x200B;

**The circulating supply is still increasing too fast.**

Too much ALGO just keeps getting minted. They increased the supply by 6x in 2021 (blue line below), and it is still increasing now. This won't stop until 2030.

[ALGORAND Circulating Supply](https://preview.redd.it/ekk34byg0m5a1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fb30f752e0baada12c330c3efcf8f72b05a45e3)

&#x200B;

**Pretty much nobody is using the chain**

The active address ratio and daily active address charts show negligble growth in two years. In fact, the green line is almost flat.

It is in almost every sense - a ghost chain. From a peak of over a million address processing transactions per day during the bullrun to just a couple thousand today.

Shillers point to this being a bear market, but look at other chains and you'll see utility has not dried up anywhere near this bad.

[Daily Active Addresses](https://preview.redd.it/1yqkpium1m5a1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb9b34225054686de4cf95bd4637e0c5bab5486a)

Put another way,

Of the ALGO wallets created on chain, only 0.3 % are actively doing anything.

[Address Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/bvk6v2uo1m5a1.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=323bc258b75be3d36c9180e1ceb349cada71b7d1)

&#x200B;

Is it all bad? No.

**Development is marginally increasing**

Github Commits have been increasing all year. Albeit slowly.

[ALGORAND Commits](https://preview.redd.it/qpa4zzf80m5a1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=d345fc5f47dffac65f048f5ff146ba7ce6a27fd9)

&#x200B;

Conclusion: My original thesis stands. While there is actually nothing wrong with the chain (despite nobody using it), there are multiple red flags abound for the foundation. Stay away.

Just want to point out that most of the exchanges and tokens that went under were down because of a sudden attack on it's achilles heels, people were not expecting.

Kwon Luna was exploited because someone saw an opportunity to make money

Voyager went bankrupt because it was highly exposed to crypto prices.

FTX was lending users money to Alameda for highly dubious leveraged bets and only needed an attack on FTT to bring him down.

Unless someone knows CZ is doing something shady and has an opportunity to exploit his scheme and earn money, Binance will not go anywhere.

Binance has had sharks lurking around for many years, people trying to exploit it trying to see if their own tokens can be exploited etc. Meanwhile these 3 I referenced never had this and only needed a simple attack on their own token to collapse.

Also if someone finds a way now, what about when gas fees are 100 bucks again? I find it very strange people are screaming to just withdraw funds to a real wallet without considering the tradeoffs.

And let's imagine that they've been behind quite a few big failures in the Cryptocurrency world like FTX (Maybe even a few others that we don't know of). Maybe even a few coming up like the possible collapse of Binance.

&#x200B;

What would their end goal be?

The end goal would  be different things and in different order. In my opinion the end goal would be in this order:

1. Create a total distrust in centralized exchanges controlled by the private sector and also in decentralized exchanges. This is to usher in a few or perhaps one big state controlled centralized exchange.
2. To create a total distrust in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and anything that seems trust worthy. This is to usher in the CBDC Central Bank Digital Currency. We kinda see this already happening in China.
3. Make an example of a few people who are sticking it to the man, like the developer of Tornado Cash who is in jail at the moment. All while SBF is roaming free and Ghislaine Maxwell (both real criminals imo) is in a medium security jail.
4. Create an overall mood of apathy toward cryptocurrencies especially those that are privacy orientated.
5. The central banks, black rock and the WEF plan on buying up as much crypto currency specifically ethereum and bitcoin right now. In case these currencies don't become irrelevant, then atleast they will be whales.
6. Assassinate as many whales as possible. Why do you think we saw three big people in the cryptocurrency die suddenly. If you go and check some old declassified training films of the OSS you will see they have great ways of doing this!!!

So, I am trying to move some coins off of CDC to my wallet but every time I try and do so I get an error that they code I put in from the authenticator app is wrong. It isn't. It is only a 6 digit code and I can easily write it down and put it in in time. I also tried to copy and paste the code and I still got the same error. At this point I am locked out for a while because it kept rejecting the code. And yes, I am using the same authenticator I have used in the past for CDC without any problem.

Have any of you ever ran into this situation and if so, what did you do to resolve it? I don't know if it matters at all, but the coin I am trying to move is CKB. 

Is there a way to maybe have my CDC account sync with a different authenticator app or reset the authenticator app? Maybe that will help?  I know CEXs have a lot of traffic of people sending coins off the exchanges, but this seems to just be the CDC and the authenticator aren't on the same page. Earlier today I did have to try and send things a few times on CB, because they seemed to be slow and overwhelmed and I got error messages a few times, but I was eventually able to send. With CBC I am totally stuck.

Then, they planned to transfer the remaining assets of FTX via these minted coins to the government officials of the Bahamas.

**Clarification:**

Around February this year Reddit (one of the main admins) reached out to top contributors on WallStreetBets. Mostly people who’ve been on the sub for quite some time and spent a loot of time there creating the community. I was one of these people.

They invited 100 contributors to a Discord server and described the whole idea of a new “NFT project”. Back then avatars weren’t even a thing. We were not promised anything and we did not even care. Let me remind you it was early 2022, the war in Ukraine just broke out and the collapse of the markets began. None of us knew if we’re gonna get anything or how much it’s gonna be worth. We did not care, we were happy to be recognised and to help.

OP claimed we did 6 hours of work, well, in reality there were thousands of messages and ideas and let me assure you— way more than 6 hours. Some people contributed less, some people more - after all we thought we are doing it for fun. The fact that it started so early and released just now proves that there’s been a lot of work put into it. Many contributors came up with the ideas of what now you see as the NFT’s properties. Once again - we were promised nothing.

The Discord server went silent around June, I guess Reddit already had an idea for how it’s gonna look like and how they’re gonna execute this, so they turned off replies. Later, Reddit admin would send us a sign-up list for t-shirts (there is a pic on my profile). I was hyped to get one, but then again - we couldn’t even send a reply on Discord and we thought the project is dead.

There was no “corruption”, no “insider dealings”, no “secret messages”, as some of the comments suggest. We were all just happy to help, and surprised when we received the message about the collection drop. Even some mods didn’t receive the avatar, and people who were on the server didn’t all get golden traits.

IMO This is a genius marketing move by Reddit to target WSB crowd, increase volume, and spread the word about Avatars and NFTs in general.

Also, why wouldn’t Reddit reward top contributors of each subreddits with rare drops? Especially when it’s a free drop for 10k people. This is just my opinion, I respect and am curious to see yours. But please don’t say the game is rigged because none of us ever asked for anything.",2022-12-13 00:20:24

"Binance might be prosecuted. “But what about SBF”, you ask?",0,zkfkgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zkfkgl/binance_might_be_prosecuted_but_what_about_sbf/,22,1670888108.0,"Before you downvote me: yes, I know: not another SBF post. But you all brought it on yourselves this time. Today we saw the same headline posted here 4-5 times, including from Reuters so it’s quite reliable: The US justice department is hesitating about pressing charges against Binance on their investigation about money laundering started in 2018.

What does it has to do with SBF you ask? Well absolutely nothing, and yet most top comments on those articles were about…you’ve guessed: SBF.    
These comments were mostly asking why they weren’t charging SBF instead and things like that.

But the answer is in the first paragraph. The investigation started in 2018, it took four years for the prosecutors to gather evidence and now they’re considering pressing charges.     
Again with a similar recent example, from the start of the Theranos scandal to E. Holmes conviction, seven years had passed. 

I know that you have the counter argument of Bernie Madoff who was arrested within days, but it was after his sons called the authorities through their lawyers etc so the Feds had a basis to arrest him straight away with those testimonies. Caroline Ellison was in NYC recently so she might be talking though, who knows. They would  also need the Bahamian authorities to cooperate and arrest and extradite him too so it’s not as easy as raiding Madoff’s home. 

I already know that some people will only read the title, and maybe the first and last paragraph, and comment straightaway “that’s because he donated to politicians”, so let’s address that. I still don’t think it’ll matter much because we discovered that he secretly donated to both parties significantly. So there’s no reason for politicians to influence the DOJ if he’s actually not helping them specifically. Also he doesn’t have any money to give anymore so he won’t be useful for them on the future.

So that’s it really, we need to be patient if we want SBF to face the justice system, because we don’t want him to get off easy on some technicality. It might take months or years if nobody is willing to cooperate fully, but it should happen eventually.


TLDR: the investigation on Binance took four years. Things like that take time and it’s only been a month since the FTX collapse.


Edit: lmao, of course I post this and he gets arrested, timing is everything",2022-12-13 01:35:08
"Because when all your shitcoins are dead, Bitcoin will still be there and you better have some.",0,zkfeh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zkfeh3/because_when_all_your_shitcoins_are_dead_bitcoin/,69,1670887731.0," **Bitcoin Core version 24**.0.1 is now available from: [https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0.1/](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-24.0.1/)

The new Bitcoin release means that the cryptocurrency is continuing to evolve and become more secure and reliable. It also means that more people are likely to adopt Bitcoin as a means of payment, which could lead to increased demand and higher prices. Additionally, the new release could introduce new features and improvements that could make the cryptocurrency more attractive to users.

See Release Notes for details: [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-24.0.1.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-24.0.1.md)

Bitcoin is different now because it has gone through several major updates and improvements since its launch in 2009. These updates have made Bitcoin **more secure, reliable, and easier to use.** Additionally, new features such as Lightning Network and SegWit have been introduced, which have improved the scalability and transaction speed of the cryptocurrency. Finally, Bitcoin has become more widely accepted and adopted, leading to increased demand and higher prices.

Despite the numerous updates and improvements, Bitcoin has stayed the same in its core principles and goals. Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized and secure digital currency, and its underlying technology and protocols have stayed the same since its launch. Additionally, Bitcoin's core features such as its limited supply and fixed block size have remained unchanged, ensuring that it remains a scarce and valuable asset.

The humor associated with Bitcoin is largely due to its decentralized nature has allowed it to become a source of comedy and parody. Furthermore, the technology behind Bitcoin is complex and ever-evolving, which can lead to **humorous situations** when people don’t understand the technology or make mistakes.

  
So giddy up and learn about Bitcoin.

ChatGPT DCA Strategy,5,zk8mls,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zk8mls/chatgpt_dca_strategy/,50,1670873022.0,"I decided to ask ChatGPT about DCA for crypto…

Question: What is a good DCA strategy for cryptocurrency?

Answer:

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a common investment strategy in which an investor divides their total investment amount into equal parts and invests that money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the asset at the time of the investment. This strategy is often used to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall investment.

In the context of cryptocurrency, a DCA strategy could involve dividing the total amount you want to invest in a particular cryptocurrency into equal amounts and buying that cryptocurrency at regular intervals, such as once per week or once per month. This can help you avoid trying to time the market and can potentially allow you to buy the cryptocurrency at a lower average price than if you were to buy it all at once.

It's important to note that no investment strategy is guaranteed to be successful, and you should always conduct your own research and carefully consider your investment decisions before investing in any cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can be risky investments, so it's important to only invest what you can afford to lose.

My response: Not specific enough, so let’s try a different question…

Question: Which tokens should I include in a DCA strategy for cryptocurrency?

Answer:
When choosing which tokens to include in a DCA strategy for cryptocurrency, it's important to conduct your own research and carefully consider your investment goals and risk tolerance. Some factors you may want to consider when choosing which tokens to include in your DCA strategy include the following:

- The market capitalization and trading volume of the cryptocurrency: Larger, more established cryptocurrencies tend to be less risky than smaller, less well-known cryptocurrencies.
- The project's team and technology: Look for projects with a strong team and a well-developed technology.
-The project's use case and potential for growth: Consider whether the project has a clear use case and potential for growth.
-The overall market conditions: It's generally a good idea to diversify your portfolio and include a mix of cryptocurrencies in different market conditions.

It's also important to remember that no investment strategy is guaranteed to be successful, and you should always carefully consider your investment decisions before investing in any cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can be risky investments, so it's important to only invest what you can afford to lose.

My response: Is ChatGPT a redditor?

TLDR: Only invest what you can afford to lose and do your own research…",2022-12-12 21:23:42

Well, it didn't fail yet, but in the current situation, I actually protected myself by making inverse DCA and selling everything I got from folding/mining/farming right away because eh... 

Crypto helped me pay the bills even in this rough year and I hope it continues and feels good to know I'm not exposed.

But I still feel like I missed this opportunity, unstaking it right now with everything I've owned would be a great way to beat all the markets and end the year with some great cash.

In the statement, Binance claimed that Reuters was “attacking our incredible law enforcement team” as the company shared the press release sent to Reuters.

The Reuters investigation claimed that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is at the cross-road of charging Binance for allegedly facilitating money laundering activities. According to Reuters, the investigation against Binance concerns unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and a violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. The leading exchange allegedly processed over $10 billion in payments for entities seeking to evade U.S. sanctions.

Reuters alleged that Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhao enforced strict secrecy rules on employees to cover up for his exchange’s violation. For example, Binance employees were informed to communicate using encrypted messaging services and to use email as little as possible.

I don't want to defend Binance, or saying they are saying the truth but we have seen from the example of ''The Block'' that the media cannot always be trusted, especially when it comes to crypto space.",2022-12-12 20:24:50

Can AI do Cryptocurrency trading better than a human being?,9,zk6b0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zk6b0h/can_ai_do_cryptocurrency_trading_better_than_a/,58,1670868087.0,"It is possible that an AI could be better at cryptocurrency trading than a human being, depending on the specific design of the AI and the strategy it uses for trading. 

In general, AI systems are able to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, and can make decisions based on complex algorithms and models. 

This can make them well-suited to tasks that require a high degree of speed and precision, such as trading on financial markets. 

However, it is worth noting that AI systems can also be subject to biases and errors, and may not always make the best decisions. 

Ultimately, the effectiveness of an AI at trading cryptocurrency would depend on its specific design and the quality of the data and algorithms it uses.

Well, Answer you read above was written by an AI. I asked this question on ChatGPT AI, and received this answer within seconds. AI is definitely getting better at a quicker pace.",2022-12-12 20:01:27

Reddit gifted a small insider group the most exclusive and valuable Reddit Avatars [Serious],355,zk2thz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zk2thz/reddit_gifted_a_small_insider_group_the_most/,290,1670860492.0,"Last week Reddit released an exclusive collection of free Reddit Avatars to the WSB community called, ""Memetic Traders x Reddit Collectible Avatars"" viewable on OpenSea here: [https://opensea.io/collection/memetic-traders-x-reddit-collectible-avatars](https://opensea.io/collection/memetic-traders-x-reddit-collectible-avatars).

This was a free drop to the top users of the WSB sub and vastly more exclusive than any free drop we've seen before. Currently there are over 4000 Avatars in this collection compared to the 4M+ free avatars Reddit has dropped. In addition, it's rarer than the paid avatars with Gen 1 and Gen 2 sitting at approximately 45,000 Avatars per each generation.

**The Issue**

I'm all for communities getting specific drops. However, the game is rigged. If a user is eligible for this drop, their avatar was randomly generated unless you were part of this insider group. Not only did this group get the first 24 drops, they got exclusive attributes that no one else at WSB got.

https://preview.redd.it/0pmwhkv4qh5a1.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8f1f83646bfb3c8c11678c1a7ad1a3f752b744

* Hat - Gold Hold (0.54% have this trait)
* Left Hand - Gold Money Printer (0.54% have this trait)
* Right Hand - Gold Rocket (0.54% have this trait)

That's right, no one besides them got these golden traits. I'll talk about gold in the next paragraph.

WSB Mod, OPINION\_IS\_UNPOPULAR got the #1 drop in this collection, a Gold Hedge Snoo ([https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xa3396af20ce52bd3c7ab6d7046be617257f60eb9/0](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xa3396af20ce52bd3c7ab6d7046be617257f60eb9/0)), which has received offers for 3 ETH. In Gen 2, the solid gold Midas Touch sold for 8+ ETH at the height of the rally. Gold is often the most desired trait across existing NFTs like CryptoPunks and Apes.

What did these 24 lucky insiders do to earn the most exclusive and rare Avatars? They partnered with a Reddit Admin and provided ideas for the collection which was about 6-8 hours of ""work"" in discord:  [https://i.redd.it/3bbrcnh0m35a1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/3bbrcnh0m35a1.jpg)

**Open Questions**

Owners of Free and Paid Avatars, what do you think about this? Should Reddit set the precedent to gift mods and insiders the best Avatars for future drops? Should Reddit be more transparent when they cherry-pick the best avatar attributes for ""special"" users when the majority are randomized? Should Reddit give individual communities free drops?

I'm all for artists getting the first drop in their collections like we've seen with Gen 1 and Gen 2. I'm also for key contributors receiving one of the early drops in a collection, but I am definitely against them receiving first dibs and **exclusive** attributes. If these insiders got random attributes like the rest of the WSB top users than I would be okay with that too.

**Edit Bonus:**

When I brought this up to the r / avatartrading community I was accused of,  ""brigading against a sub and moderators which is a violating of Reddit TOS."" The mod locked my post for commenting and then retracted it once the WSB main mod (Opinion) wanted to comment.

Below is an argument written by cryotosensei which won 2nd place in the Binance Coin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> 
> 
> 1. BNB has attracted some negative press. In June 2022, the SEC announced its intention to investigate whether Binance sold it as an unregistered security during the initial coin offering in 2017. Depending on how the investigation evolves, the price movement of BNB could be impacted negatively.
> 2. BNB is the native token of Binance and is designed for use in the Binance ecosystem. However, in June 2021, Binance Markets Limited - a legal entity affiliated with Binance - was forbidden by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial regulator to conduct regulated activities in the U.K. Similarly, in September 2021, Binance fell out of flavour with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as it prohibited Binance from providing payment services and soliciting business from Singapore residents. Likewise, Binance is not allowed to do business in Japan. While Binance plans to relaunch its operations in the U.K. in the near future, it is still facing regulatory woes in other countries. If BNB is not globally adopted, it may face limitations in terms of how high its price can soar.
> 3. BNB runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is susceptible to rug pulls. In 2021, 73,000 BNB was drained from Meerkat Finance, a yield farming protocol. That same year, TurtleDex absconded with 9,000 BNB shortly after its launch. In 2022, the TopGoal project team cheated their investors of more than 2,660 BNB. Rug pulls happen so frequently on the BSC chain that the attitude of “use at your own risk” has come to be associated with BNB.

Below is an argument written by Far-Scholar9028 which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the bitcoin blockchain is essential if you're considering investing in bitcoin. In the previous thread, we named a few pros of BTC, now let's move on to the cons of BTC.
> 
> **Volatility**
> 
> Bitcoin is a traders dream due to volatility, however that is also one of its biggest issues. Bitcoin will never be used as a currency due to price fluctuations. If a car was first purchased for 2 BTC and returned a week later, for instance, should 2 BTC be returned despite the fact that the valuation has increased, or should the new amount (calculated in accordance with current valuation) be sent? 
> 
> **Security**
> 
> Bitcoin Network Security: There might be undiscovered weaknesses in the Bitcoin system. Due to the fact that this system is still relatively new, if Bitcoins were to become extensively used and a fault was discovered, it might greatly increase the wealth of the exploiter at the risk of destroying the Bitcoin economy.
> 
> Wallet Security: Wallets are primed to be lost, hacked and stolen. Bitcoins are virtually lost if a hard drive crashes, a virus corrupts data, the wallet file is corrupted, and the seed phrase is not backed up. Nothing could be done to get it back. These coins will remain abandoned in the system forever. Investors and users could become bankrupt as a result in a matter of seconds with no chance of recovery. 
> 
> **Proof-of-Work**
> 
> The PoW is a mechanism for assisting a group of strangers who are also self-interested, equal, and there are no subordinates in the network, according to the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. PoW requires a lot of energy. It's expensive and demands a lot of processing power. It is susceptible to the infamous 51% assault, which means that if hostile miners control 51% of the network, they might seize dominance and render decentralization useless.

Comment,1,j0o8zav,,0,1671336913.0,"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Writing a Pro argument for Bitcoin in 2022 seems complicated because everything has been said... or did it?
> 
> Edit: I have a small bag of Bitcoin currently valued around 600 bucks. I am also invested in crypto around 2000 bucks which are always moving when Bitcoin is moving. Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =) 
> 
> # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin
> 
> So as the title suggests it, the recent news from Ethereum switching from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. In this write up we are not going to talk about speculation or the financial side of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment and if you want to read one, just go to past cointests.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This won't be tackled at all as I think it deserves its own topic.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 1) Bitcoin: High security
> 
> This topic has also been talked to death: Bitcoin is ultra secure thanks to its Blockchain and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> >Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well-known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through ""bitcoin mining."" Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.  
> >  
> >[IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:
> 
> >Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  
> >  
> >[USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:~:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: ""Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?""
> 
> [The hashrate is at an ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:~:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so.
> 
> While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.
> 
> Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now?
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> >The Energy Fud Was Killed
> 
> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.
> 
> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.
> 
> There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector.
> 
> >[My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: Bitcoin is the flagship of POW and it is a feature not a bug.
> 
> Bitcoin, thanks to its value and tokenomics is seen as a good investment, this is also why miners commit huge amount of ressources to take the hashrate to new heights. These miners help the US grid to become more and more resilient. The future of Crypto and of green energy relies a lot on Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven time and time again that it can shoulder these changes. Bitcoin is a good piece of technology and I hope people continue to invest in it because it is doing a lot of good for our future !

Stablecoin redemptions would be impossible for the most known ones afaik (usdt,usdc,busd).

how so? genuinely curious. from what I understand, USDT has 68% of their backing in US treasuries and cash so I don't see how redemptions will be impossible

People give tether USD to get USDT in return , and can redeem USDT for USD directly with tether.  I can't see that tether uses silvergate as their banking service and it doesn't go through crypto exchanges

Comment,1,j0o7a8f,,0,1671336015.0,"#Regulation Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by noxtrifle which won 1st place in the Regulation Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Government regulation generally refers to the degree of control that government have over something, and in this case, cryptocurrencies. Various countries around the world have mixed regulatory perspectives on cryptocurrencies, and as such have restricted whether its citizens can trade, purchase, or mine cryptocurrencies. However, regulation is beneficial for a number of reasons:
> 
> * **Safer market for investors**
>    * Described as the ""Wild West"" by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the cryptocurrency space, due to a lack of regulation which makes it a trivial task to create a project, is full of thousands of fraudulent tokens and pyramid schemes (case in point: BitConnect, while it still existed) and burgeoning projects that never come to fruition.
>    * [Last year alone](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/), over $7 billion was swindled out of cryptocurrency investors, a figure which is $2.8 billion larger than that of 2020.
>    * With the added regulation that may require new tokens to dox the founders and file ICOs or launches similarly to the way IPOs are documented in the stock market, another level of accountability is created that makes it near-impossible for a rugpull or Ponzi scheme to occur.
> * **Increased investor confidence**
>    * Currently, a significant barrier to mainstream cryptocurrency is the lack of regulation in the space — without concrete legislation in place to ensure safety, most companies, and by extension, people, will be unwilling to adopt cryptocurrencies.
>    * In a situation where their funds in the bank are backed by the government but their cryptocurrency is not, it currently makes no sense for companies to choose cryptocurrencies over traditional banking systems.
> * **Encourages innovation**
>    * If each country implements crypto regulation that servers to boost it as an alternative financial method rather than stifle it, several regulatory barriers can be broken (case in point: the long-awaited Grayscale Bitcoin ETF)

> - SHIB doesn't really have a use case well defined. There are some people accepting it as a payment, there are some NFT being minted, but all without a clear use besides hodling.
> 
> - The developers are anonymous, nobody know who they are and what they got out of it.
> 
> - ShibaSwap is not well developed, lots of manual processes, rewards are deployed manually, last reward cycle delayed due to a dev having personal issues. The security excuse for it at this day and age is a red flag
> 
> - Roadmap is full of ideas but still lacks a clear vision on what is SHIB going to address and make itself relevant. The ecosystem has 3 coins, with another 2 on the horizon, but again, no real use case for them. Feels like they just throw some words like ""governance"" but what is it governing? What pairs are to be added to the swap? What else? 
> 
> All in all, it comes down to lack of an appealing use case. It's marketed as community experiment, but it feels like a group of people with wishful thinking trying to make the coin value go up.

Below is an argument written by warmbookworm which won 2nd place in the Shiba Inu Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> There are several pros to Shiba Inu, as we as several common misconceptions about what value is and what makes something valuable that people who write off memecoins like Shib are usually prone to making. 
> 
> First of all, the pros: Shiba Inu is the third most searched for cryptocurrency in 2021. It has grown to become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by marketcap, even surpassing Dogecoin, the first and by far the biggest memecoin since alt coins existed. This is huge because as we've seen with bitcoin, the first mover advantage is huge; no other coin has come close to surpassing bitcoin yet, despite tens of thousands of coins coming to existence in recent years.
> 
> Shiba Inu clearly has one of the largest network effects in the entire industry, which is arguably the most important metric for any crypto. 
> 
> You can easily buy Shib on platforms like Webull, so people who are not into crypto can still get in and buy shib, making it far more accessible than all but the largest and most well-known cryptocurrencies. 
> 
> Finally, Shib has great branding. The idea of the ""Shib Army"" and ""Shib to 1 cent"" (or even a dollar) is incredibly good marketing, because it gives the community a common identity, as well as a goal to work towards. If we take any other crypto, people might like the coin and want it to go up, but there is no singular goal that everyone can point to and talk about. Thus, people are much less likely to contribute towards the development and branding of the coin. 
> 
> Secondly, the ""shib-lingo"", with LEASH and BONE as well as other parts of the shiba inu ecosystem allows for a much more intuitive understanding of crypto for those who find it too challenging to understand and can't be bothered to learn about all of the ins and outs of crypto itself. It is a great gateway for complete beginners to start understanding all of the different crypto terminology in words and concepts they already understand. 
> 
> ----------------------------
> 
> Now in terms of misconceptions regarding value, most people think that you need to have a ""use-case"" for value. But what is a use-case? Really, a use-case is just a ""feature"". i.e they think that every coin has to have some special feature or property that other coins don't have in order for it to be valuable.
> 
> This makes sense intuitively, but isn't how things actually work. Just because something has a unique feature doesn't mean that that feature is useful. For example, if you were to take YouTube's source code today and slightly improve the UI, you would have a ""superior YouTube"", but no one would use it. 
> 
> Network effects far outweigh any features in terms of importance. Furthermore, the idea that features have to come *before* value is intuitive, but actually, as we've seen, because of the Shib network being adopted, there are DApps being developed on it, like wallets and exchanges to begin with, and eventually, there will probably be a lot more products and services being built on top of Shib in the future, as long as it continues to hold value. 
> 
> Because it isn't just feature that create value. Rather, developers chase after the money. Where there is money, where there are incentives, that's where people will build, and that in itself will grow the ecosystem.
> 
> disclosure: I do not hold any SHIB and never will.

Comment,1,j0o5kh6,,0,1671335121.0,"#Regulation Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by noxtrifle which won 1st place in the Regulation Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Government regulation generally refers to the degree of control that government have over something, and in this case, cryptocurrencies. Various countries around the world have mixed regulatory perspectives on cryptocurrencies, and as such have restricted whether its citizens can trade, purchase, or mine cryptocurrencies. However, this restriction of cryptocurrency adoption is not beneficial for investors and companies for several reasons:
> 
> * **Price**
>    * One of the most obvious arguments against government regulation is that it will inevitably cause crypto prices to decrease, as seen when China announced (several times) its cryptocurrency bans. 
> * **Sacrifice of Purpose**
>    * The widespread implementation of government regulations [naturally bring them into the industry](https://amt-lab.org/blog/2022/3/risks-and-regulations-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-space), which goes against the fundamental nature of cryptocurrencies as a means of transacting pseudonymously without regulatory oversight.
>    * If this purpose is sacrificed in pursuit of a safer space, there may very well be no space left to make safer; as most investors would pull out of cryptocurrencies because there will remain no purpose to stay invested. 
> * **Banking Restrictions**
>    * In the worst case scenario where regulation deems cryptocurrencies illegal, third-party providers may be hesitant to provide services such as bank accounts or exchanges if the government is refusing to recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender. Without these services, investors are unable to easily withdraw or deposit their funds. 
> * **Reduction in Product Offerings**
>    * Continuing the worst-case scenario, in a world where tech companies, banks and startups are looking for ways to utilize blockchain technologies, government regulation will force them to alter their products and services in order to continue operating within jurisdictions that have banned cryptocurrency adoption. 
>    * By narrowing down the array of investment options, the flexibility of blockchain technology will be reduced significantly.

> Crypto, at this stage, is full of scams, manipulation, and insider trading. These are a few things that government regulation may help protect the retail investors from. As we know the implosion of Terra, 3ac, Celcius, retail is always hit hardest.
> 
> **Prevent money laundering, tax evasion, sanction evasion**
> 
> Regulation is necessary because criminals use the anonymity of cryptocurrency trading to launder their stolen money. There is concern that cryptocurrencies are being used as a conduit for money from illicit operations or to fund terrorism and evade sanctions. 
> 
> **Convince Institutions of cryptos legitimacy**
> 
> Institutional investors, who are subject to stringent compliance and risk management requirements, would gain confidence from regulation. For instance, an institution can become the target of a criminal investigation if it is discovered that it transacted in bitcoin assets that were later linked to unlawful activity.

This is how you demonstrate someone is not thinking rationally, for example if they're deep into a conspiracy theory:

Comment,1,j0o59v2,,0,1671334970.0,">Who did what and what penalties they may or may not have paid is a wholly separate issue from what systemic changes were instituted, and what implications those changes have going forward.

Actually... its the same issue..
Because it was a heavily regulated market prior to it happening.

If you think the market isn't at risk now, you must be living with your head in the clouds. Look at the housing bubble before us.. its unsustainable..

CDOs. Synethic CDOs. Derivatives (the trillions of dollars waiting to collapse - hence why people try to promote Crypto to get out of the Fiat bullshit and put some real value behind currency - the grand idea).. these things still exist.

Comment,0,j0o37nt,,0,1671333906.0,"They date/marry for power, control and money just like the Royals & Oligarchs of old. They can have x, y, z number of beautiful people on the side for their own pleasure reasons. The reason they don't marry or date these beautiful people is that their world basically requires you to build power alliances and strengthen your hand. By having someone who is just a pretty face as your partner (and not part of a powerful family or obscenely wealthy) it only weakens your position if they don't bring anything else to the table power/control/money wise. 

You just never hear about these ""other GFs/BFS"" because these temp people get x amount of money in their bank account and a monthly salary to do nothing as a fake employee at one of their companies. So these people just STFU take the lifestyle ride rather than rock the boat and their gravy train. They are all doing it so there is no worry about ""exposing"" since the Husband and Wife are both enjoying the same power couple + extras arrangement. Normal people are almost pleasures to them or even objects not actual human beings. 

I have worked with some very very rich people and they quite literally see you the same way we see a new car/iphone or if you are very exceptional like a pet. They are proud of their ownership of you in whatever modicum of time it is but that is about it. You are a possession. Unless you are one of them status wise you will never be seen or treated as equal which is why they only date/marry in their own power class or they flit from fling to fling with people of no consequence as they don't want/require a power partner just a new toy.....",2022-12-18 05:25:06

Comment,1,j0o22jt,,0,1671333321.0,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by noxtrifle which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> NFTs are also known as non-fungible tokens, which at a high level are smart contracts integrated with multimedia, all of which exist on the blockchain. Although they have numerous uses in the real world, NFTs are denounced by most people who are familiar with them. There are several reasons behind such sentiments:
> 
> * **Environmental Impact**
>    * NFTs are primarily used on the Ethereum blockchain, so one can take that as an example when discussing their environmental impact.
>    * Each transaction under the current PoW system consumes 48KwH of energy, or the same energy usage as the average US household would use in [1.5 days](https://nftexplained.info/how-much-energy-does-an-nft-use/).
>       * There is also the [positive feedback loop](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) that we can consider: as more NFTs are used (for example on Ethereum), the price of the token will increase — causing more miners to start mining Ethereum and push up emissions even more while reducing gas prices and transaction times. This could make the network (and NFTs) more popular, continuing the cycle.
>    * When considering that most NFT transactions are of the 'visual collectible' kind (case in point: BAYC and Reddit Avatars), this magnitude of energy usage is unnecessary and will not contribute to the redemption of NFTs in the public eye.
> * **Intellectual Property Concerns**
>    * NFTs raise several concerns relating to copyrights and the true owners of art.
>       * [An example of this](https://www.gtlaw.com.au\/knowledge/ip-commercialisation-virtual-world-part-1-non-fungible-tokens-nfts) is when Miramax filed a case against Quentin Tarantino for the publication of the Pulp Fiction script as an NFT, and the true owner of the intellectual property was unclear.
>    * There is also the classic 'Ctrl C Ctrl V' argument, in which NFTs' copyrights can easily be infringed upon by making a free copy of the image.
> * **Regulatory Concerns**
>    * NFTs in most major countries are unregulated and unclassified as to whether they are a security or a digital asset, which brings into question the same concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies.
>    * The unregulated nature of NFTs is also a barrier for law-conscious people who intend to enter the NFT market.
> * **Security**
>    * Like anything on the blockchain, NFTs can (and will) be hacked, especially if they are of value. Attackers can target the NFT's distributors or the owners themselves, causing costly losses that in most cases are not recoverable.
> * **Money Laundering**
>    * One could create an NFT, buy it from themselves with dirty money, and realize the profit as completely legitimate. For example, if a person made $500,000 through illegal means, they could create any type of NFT from another account and buy it with their own $500,000. 
>    * As such, when it’s time to pay taxes, they can deny any association with the first account and [pretend that they found a buyer for their NFT.](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/nft-money-laundering-what-you-need-to-know/)
>       * This is largely fuelled by the fact that most NFT exchanges do not require one to verify your identity, and that one can make an infinite number of cryptocurrency wallets — enabling the potential for a similarly infinite number of cases of money laundering.

Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> # NFT, the tech that will change the world. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Welcome to this small presentation that will try to explain how NFT is a world changing technology. First of all, I won't discuss the application for the art world because I can't fathom writing an argument trying to defend absurdities and JPEG worth millions. If you want to read my take on this trend, read my con-argument (if I write one). 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> NFT technology promises to be game changing for multiple reasons. We are going to tackle three main aspects of NFT. The first will be IP and property related. The second will be about exchangeable virtual assets. And the last will be about virtual ID, and administrative documents. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # NFTs and property: the future of property management. 
> 
> This argument is an attempt to show how the use-cases of NFTs can improve the world. I don't know if a company is doing what I suggest and I don't have the ability to sell this idea or whatever so you can grab it and develop it. This is clearly what will happen and everyone should be preparing for it: The great migration of property management. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Nowadays, to find who owns which property you need to search for it on a database, often parts of these databases are not online and you need to go to the Town hall or Town archives to find outdated data about someone who died and then search for eventual kids. Lost property through time and administrative black holes are a pain to manage and are often stopping project or not allowing people to get paid when they get expropriated because of some public works. 
> 
> Blockchain through the use of NFT can solve this problem. When each property is linked to a token which is turn can be link to biometric data or some kind of secure access, then, property can be moved, traced, and people can offer money for the property without accessing the identity of the owner. This database, through the use of blockchain, would be far more secure than any database we have right now. 
> 
> In France, some properties are lost because people can reach the person who is supposed to inherit the property. With a smart system associated to a blockchain, upon the death of anyone, their account would send a smart contract to the owner of the blockchain (the government) which would apply the will of the deceased. The NFTs would then be sent to the next of kin or to the persons supposed to get them. 
> 
> Of course, some property would still end up managed by the state if the person doesn't connect to their online space or doesn't connect to any public services. This system is not a question of If but a question of when. This is what NFTs put on the table for classic properties. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> For Intellectual properties, right now there are multiple companies which are renewing the intellectual properties for their client in multiple countries. This system is antiquated and blockchain technology promises to crush these companies as soon as blockchain adoption will hit the sector (It is starting to see the light of day through companies and start up). The renewing of the IPs would simply become a smart contract and the payment would be fees in a stablecoin. This would allow a simplification of the whole industry and through the emergence of a global standard, to know which companies can use which IP. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Nfts will also change the entertainment industry through virtual assets. Let's dig in how it can be an opportunity for both consumers and companies. 
> 
> # Imagine League of Legend with a secondary market, Renting skins, Selling skins, Exchanging Skins and other cosmetics. 
> 
> Nft games tend to be predatory but they don't need to. We need to start to see NFTs as an opportunity to have control on our virtual assets. These assets don't need to be scarce to have value and a secondary market is not a net loss for a company. Let's dig in. This whole part will take League of Legend as an example. You can apply the same thoughts to games with a similar monetization. 
> 
> Right now Riot games sells their new skins and then the hype fades and another line of skin is sold. Most skins have fixed prices and unless a temporary promo, they don't tend to change their price point. With a secondary market, Riot could capitalize on the hype cycle by monetizing the perceived value of old skins while collecting data on good pricing for their promos. 
> 
> By allowing people to Rent and sell or exchange skins from one another, with a proportional or flat fee paid to riot for maintaining the blockchain and for their profit margins, people would be able to buy the skins they want from people who don't use them anymore. The fact that all transactions are done in a money which is not exchangeable in fiat means that this system would be a closed system. This new service would just mean more use for riot points which could in turn translate to more profits. 
> 
> This is a good application of NFTs and we can even imagine a successful implementation while using real crypto-currencies or fiat. 
> 
> NFTs allows these properties to be secured and exchanged by smart contracts and, through a good security, to never be lost. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # The biggest change: Data management in governing authorities. 
> 
> Lastly, NFTs promise to revolutionize the way countries are managing their data. Just like the management of properties, governmental databases are often old, incomplete and not numerized. The opportunity for NFT technology is enormous. Anyone through their biometrics or other secure way could access all the data collected about them by the state and get a copy of any document any time. The government, when needed, could also find data points about people in a dynamic way. You need data about people aged 50 or more who were born in a state and worked in a specific sector => easy peasy. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> The NFT aspect of the tool would be that all the documents would appear in your data wallet and that you could control through smart contracts who gets them. For example, you need an ID to rent some place, just connect to your wallet and send a copy to your landlord. This copy would be a token which would disappear when the landlord would confirm your identity to complete your file or after some time. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> The uses and practicality are infinite.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: Nfts are not JPEG, they are a disruptive technology and promise to allow users to simplify their daily lives. 
> 
> Through this small argument, I have presented how NFTs are promising to change our world for the better. Each use-case is of course flawed and could be used in malicious ways by governments, YET they all provide utility and would be game changing if applied to their sectors. 
> 
> NFT application is not a question. The only question is WHEN. Selling JPEG may have been profitable in the short run but companies managing NFTS at the scale of a government or at the scale of the international regulation of intellectual properties will grow to be multi billion companies.

>  Disruption is on the way and a better world is on the way. All thanks to these three letters.

Good chance the actual bottom is after the next BTC's halving. The bottom happens when people who can't hold long-term finally sell.

Many are holding out for the next BTC halving to do miracles and kickstart the bull run XD. Right now, the Fed is very likely to tighten the money supply right into 2024. There won't be any leverage or people mortgaging out their houses for cheap credit to pump BTC to the next ATH. Hodlers will be disappointed and finally capitulate when they see two years of holding gets them a nothing burger. BTC miners will be forced to dump their reserves as halving cuts their income and price hasn't recovered. 2024 will be a massive disappointment and a final shitshow.

But don't worry. There will be a pump from degens/moonboys anticipating the future chart to play out like the past. Just make sure to sell to them and let them be the bagholders.",2022-12-18 05:06:58

If he is offered a shorter sentence than he is likely to get if he goes to court, he should take that deal and that deal would involve ""cooperating"" with information about the others in FTX.

He may not even be offered a plea deal and if he is it may be so onerous that he just takes his chances in court. He could get 115 years but he would also get 20 years if all the sentences were to run concurrently. Going to court is a big gamble for him.

If the government offers a plea deal for 15 years, the public will shout ""cover-up"" so it may not be in the government's interest to offer a plea deal. Cooperating to convict all the others may be the only reason for the government to offer any kind of deal.

Attacker used lots of social engineering the [Seaport Drainer method](https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560) to get the victim to sign 2 [setApproveForAll transactions](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b7c5e5539f42e79468ec0a1d2cff19c741e49bc78224838d929da6efe528963) signature requests for all their BAYCs.

This is a known scam I've seen mentioned multiple times on /r/ethdev that's been around since the start of OpenSea. Hard to fall for if you're aware of this method, but easy to fall for if aren't constantly checking website addresses.

The only problem is that they recently lost a lot of trust due to their Gemini Earn platform halting after Genesis went down.
